I’m back. I’m back.

From Majorca! The Spanish island full of sun, sand, great tennis players, and…British people.

‘Take me back’

Yep, 3 million British tourists go through Majorca each year, and almost as many Germans. In fact, it’s pretty hard to find a Spanish person – or a good price for a beer – anywhere.

That’s not to say it is a bad thing. The beaches are great, the beer is cold, and the food is good. It’s nice to be able to speak English on holiday, especially when my Spanish is…improving.

Rented a car while there, a little Fiat 500, in manual, which was surprisingly really fun. She had a hard time – no gear change was made under 6000RPM – but the old girl really came into her own. Foot to the floor up hills, couldn’t keep it over 100. Was pretty fun overtaking when you have 80HP.

Fast, sleek, sexy, affordable. Great on gas too

So am I still continuing with the blog? Fuck yes I am. Currently jumping into some exciting projects using DSC and Chocolatey, to make building servers and PC’s fully automated. Pretty cool stuff right?

It’s been a great break, so before I get to the hardcore infosec stuff, ponder this:

_Are the pants industry and the purse industry are working together to keep women’s pockets small in order to force us to buy purses?_

We may never know.
