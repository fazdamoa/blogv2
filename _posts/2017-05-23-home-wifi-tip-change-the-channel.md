### [Home Wifi Tip: Change the Channel](https://fazthebro.com/2017/05/23/home-wifi-tip-change-the-channel/)

Shitty home WiFi? It may be because of your channel!  
WiFi signals are sent out on a ‘channel’, which is basically a number the signal is broadcasted at. If two people next to each other are on the same channel, the signal gets distorted and unhappy.

You likely have two signals coming from your router: 5ghz and 2.4ghz. All new phones will be using the former, but your laptop (and budget phones) may be using the latter.

1.  Download [Wifi Analyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer&hl=en_GB) from the App Store/Play Store
2.  Have a look at the channel graph on 5G and 2.4G, see how many are overlapping. For example, look at this clusterfuck on 2.4 at my work:

    Really impress your date: ‘The wifi in here has many overlapping humps, like we might be, m’ lady’
    
3.  Pick a spot in between your neighbors. As you can see, we have multiple points, (MWG) which are spaced out to avoid problems.
4.  Log in to your router – instructions how are normally printed on it – and change to the signal free number! This is very easy on 5ghz, the range is very large.

That’s about all there is to it. It’s so easy when you know how.
