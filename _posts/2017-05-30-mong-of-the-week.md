This weeks Mong comes from one of the great Mongspawns:

**Brixton.**

Inside a very busy, lightly staffed bar, our Mong decides to buy a round of 10 drinks for all the boys. £50 total. Wants to pay by card:

_Declined_

Oh well, fair enough, he probably just got the pin wrong. Trying again:

_Declined_

Right, either this guy is really thick or has no money. Again?

_Declined_

Oblivious to the huge queue behind him (with me beside him) he takes out his phone to check his balance on the card. Waitress now looking at me, like ‘what the fuck is this guy doing…’  
After a few minutes, I see he has £47 on his card. Was going to offer him a couple quid to pay the rest but didn’t have any. He asks to pay 40 on that card, and another 10 on his other card. Waitress reluctantly agrees. 40 goes through fine, and then £10 on the second card….

_Declined_

So I’m pretty frustrated, say to him ‘mate just get one of your friends to pay this, what the fuck are you doing’ etc etc  
He ignores me, proceeds to open up the app for his second card…has £6 on it.

Our Mong then is just staring blankly at his phone, wondering what to do now. One of his more intelligent friends sees the problem, comes over and just pays the 10. Finally he is gone! 1 Minute later, my rum and cokes are poured and my contactless goes through.

Later on in the night, the guy shoves me for ‘being a dick at the bar.’

What a Mong.
