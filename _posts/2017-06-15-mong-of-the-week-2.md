This week’s Mong comes from the greatest spawn of Mongs in the southern hemisphere – and arguably the world – _Australia._

After having a delicious Thai meal in a restaurant down the road, we are waiting to pay. A table of loud obnoxious people (our Aussies) are looking over their bill, and are clearly puzzled. They ask for some clarification, presumably for some Thai words they don’t understand.

> “Excuse me, what is this ‘gratuity’? We didn’t order that.”

The Thai waitress froze, unsure on how to explain this without making them look like complete imbeciles.

> “Ah, that is the service charge, you don’t have to pay it if you wish”

The Aussies didn’t realise at all how stupid they looked, and said “Oh ok! We are happy to pay it.”

Mongs!
