Don’t forget to wrap up your systems

We have all heard of Petya by now, the huge attack that mainly affected Ukraine. The 3rd largest law firm in the world was reduced to pen and paper for a week, and shipping firm TNT was out for days. But there is one other story that may be slightly more relevant for the boys…

This recent cyber-attack is going to cost Reckitt, one of the worlds biggest companies, £100m. Reckitt is known for owning Nurofen amongst other brands. Their suppliers got hit by the attack, putting shipping orders on hold for days.

The main problem with this is: Reckitt also own _Durex._ AND _Dettol._

Not only does this put your PC in danger of a virus, there are ramifications outside of cyberspace as well.  Not being able to wrap up – or take Dettol precautions after a ‘featherlite’ run – could cause problems for punters. Even getting that far may be difficult if you can’t flash a display pack!

Gotta watch your _hard and soft_ procedures boys. Beautifully put Neil, I’ll stick to Listerine thanks.
