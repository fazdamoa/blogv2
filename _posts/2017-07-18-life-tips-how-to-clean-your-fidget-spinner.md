After a week, my spinner started drastically going down in performance. From 2 minute spins, to 30 seconds – I was getting pretty depressed.

When you look closely at the bearing, you can actually see rust spots and dirt on the balls. These build up every few days from moisture in the air, and not enough spinning.

1.  Open up the bearing cover by pulling it or unscrewing it
2.  Get some Isopropyl alcohol or meths. Pour a small amount in.
3.  Spin that motherfucker dry!

This is the most effective way of cleaning. DON’T use WD40 or other oils, they actually hinder performance. Plus you can mix the Alcohol with a bit of juice or coke for a refreshing drink!
