Just got back from an epic day out in – what can only be described as – ‘not a shithole’ Bruges!!

It really is a fairytale town. All the canals and bridges and cobbled streets and  churches, all that beautiful fucking fairytale stuff, how can that not be somebody’s fucking thing, eh?

How can the swans not be somebodys fucking thing?

After a walk around the main square looking for some food we did the usual _Hmmm I don’t know about this restaurant. Let’s keep looking, maybe somewhere outside of the square? A street over will be cheaper._

30 minutes later…ended in a tourist trap restaurant. Fuck it, the beer was gooudt. Certified mint.

Beers, mussels, fries, and Brussels.

Next we went up the bell tower. Gotta say if you haven’t been – it is really narrow!!

We survived the climb down (took a lot longer than I thought, the movie may not be entirely inaccurate with how much time Ken has to climb up and jump)

What am I trying to say? You’re a bunch of fookin elephants!!

Ended up in a pub overlooking the canal, got pretty thirsty from the climb. We thought we should probably try and find some spots from the movie before we left. Should fate have it, the pub we were in, was in fact _the Hotel from the movie!_ Ray jumped into the canal right in front of our faces.

Brill time out!
