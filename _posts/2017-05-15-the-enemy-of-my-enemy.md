Well, where to begin? Sorry for taking so long guys, and thanks for the letters, I appreciate it. Let’s get started.

WANNACRY
--------

*   74 countries hit so far
*   200,000 computers
*   NHS and Spain’s Telefonica crippled

One of the largest cyber attacks in history, Wannacrypt has literally swept the continent. So what is it? Basically, it is a virus that encrypts your personal files. This can be thought of as locking them, and a password needed to get open them again. The password can be purchased for around $300.

If you get hit, and you lose things, you probably are safe to pay the money. To be fair, the guys doing the scam are very helpful in getting the files back – much better customer service than some other websites \*cough\* \*Ryanair\* \*cough\* \*cunts\* \*cough cough\*

_“I don’t have anything on my PC I care about, I don’t need to be protected”_

Do you have personal photos? Documents? All these will be lost together, unless they are backed up somewhere else.  
Have Dropbox/Google drive as a backup? Is it a linked folder on your PC? Bye-bye.

_How can I protect myself?_

DO YOUR WINDOWS UPDATES. IT’S THAT SIMPLE. DO THEM TONIGHT. GET OFF FUCKING XP. DON’T OPEN RANDOM FILES FROM THE WEB.  
Backup your photos properly:

*   Current set on the phone
*   Free backup to google drive/icloud
*   External hard drive updated often (not attached to pc)

This is going to be a big one. Our company hasn’t been hit, cause i’m the man. Get your GPOs, SMBv1 disabled, FSRM, Canarys in check admins.

If you can’t afford Windows, I’ll put a guide and some links to get it free\*

Stay safe homies!
