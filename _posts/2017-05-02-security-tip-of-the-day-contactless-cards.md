Two years ago, I would hear: “_I don’t trust contactless, I don’t want someone able to just take my wallet and go nuts.”_

We never hear that now, and why? Because contactless is fuckin awesome and if you don’t use it you are a **mong**. Plus it has a perfect cap for a round of beers.

In today’s special, we are talking contactless, Android/Apple Pay, and of course, security. Contactless is currently the most secure way to pay for goods at a till. Cash can be stolen, cards skimmed, contactless…can’t if you do it right.

**Tip 1: Use Android or Apple pay.**

Fingerprint auth. Virtual card numbers. Sex. When you pay with one of these apps, a one-time virtual credit card number is created for you, every transaction. This way, the retailer never knows what your real card number is – and can’t buy anything even with the full card details. Also, if you lose your wallet, your card can be used. If you lose your phone, your card (should be) protected by your fingerprint/PIN. Gets me hard thinking of it.

**Tip 2: Check your receipts (London)**

If for some sick reason you have to use your real card, make sure to check the receipt they offer you (especially in bars). Many bars will give you the Merchant receipt back, which has your full card details printed on there, complete with expiry date.  In a bar, reprobates are known to pick these up and sell them.

**Tip 3: Wrap Up**

If you can’t make payments through your wallet, then you are probably safe. A popular new scam on public transport in London is on the rise, whereby a reprobate carries a small contactless terminal on their person, and press it against your wallet in your pocket, hoping for a payment. Special cases/thick wallets/awareness are the best combat for this.

Hope you enjoyed the tip of the day, let us know in the comments your favourite contactless tricks!
