The only thing that could make this fight entertaining is if Conor throws a kick by mistake

**Time in BST:**  
The fight is due to start at about 5.30am BST on Sunday 27 August in the UK (9.30pm on Saturday local time in Las Vegas).

**Stream:  
**I will post a good stream here closer to the time. Cmon, you would have to be retarded to pay for this.  
Lets be honest, this is a farce, they are both doing it purely for money, McGregor has 0 chance of winning this and he knows it.

**Funny take-away:**

Trying to find the start time for this fight was harder than I thought it should be. Take a look at this paragraph from the Telegraph:

> ### What date is the fight and at what time?
> 
> The fight is happening on Saturday 26 August. While the times haven’t been announced, it will certainly be a late night or very early start for viewers in the UK, so expect to be up well into Sunday 27 August, and possibly calling in sick on Monday 28. The main event begins at 4am BST, but the fight itself may start closer to 5am.

Can’t translate it? Neither can I. Is the fight on Sunday or Saturday UK time? Why do I need to get Monday off (even though its a bank holiday…?)

Mongs.
