Great nick 50 years on

If you had to say one thing that would rise passions from the boys – it would have to be the Victoria Line. The Victoria Line is what separates the ‘_God I hate the tube’_ commuters and the _‘God I love the Bullet. Thank you Viccy. Godspeed.’_ commuters.

Constructed in the 1960s, it was the first entirely new Underground line in London for 50 years, and is one of two entirely ‘Underground’ lines (the other being W&C).  It is used by 200 million passengers each year, making it the sixth-most heavily used line on the network in absolute figures, but in terms of the average number of journeys per mile it is by far the most intensively used line. With good reason!  
It has always been driverless – although a driver sits there. Every day. Getting paid £50k to tell people ‘away from the doors please’.

Now, it is one of the most iconic and beloved attractions in London. I take it every day, and to be honest, the only times I am late to work are on tube strike days. It’s reliable, fast, and friendly – go say gidday to the friendly staff at any station 🙂

**Fun facts:**

When the Circle Line opened in 1884, the experience of riding it was described in The Times as “a form of mild torture”.

The original trains had three different classes, costing three, four and six pence for a single journey.  l A single cash journey in Zone 1 now costs £4.50.

Three babies have been born in the London Underground. The most recent was a boy, born in December 2008.
