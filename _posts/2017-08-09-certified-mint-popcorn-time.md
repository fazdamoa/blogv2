Wow. I had always heard about it, but never thought it would be _THIS_ good.

PopcornTime is the Netflix for pirates. It streams Torrents in real-time, has a huge movie and show library, and it’s all in glorious HD.  
The Windows UI looks like Netflix. It’s as simple as clicking the movie title, and bam you are seeing the latest titles!

As PopcornTime is provided by  pirates and not fat-cats – the library is huge, the interface works well, it supports ChromeCast out of the box (ahem, Amazon, ahem, cunts\*) and of course, its **free**.

It’s available on Windows, Mac and Android. Sorry iPhone users. But you knew you couldn’t access cool shit when you bought one.
