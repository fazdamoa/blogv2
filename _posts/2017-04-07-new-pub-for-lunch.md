Lads decided to go to a new pub for lunch, as the old wetherspoons is closed.

F-Man had his first ever veggie burger, which made him want to window.

Beautiful sun was out so a great time had by all (fraser and richie – partly jase). 2 Pints consumed by the ‘lads’

**Phil vision:**

_God it’s cold outside, like my heart. It better not be cold in the – oh fucking hell it’s cold in this pub too. Even colder. \*give j-mon a ‘what are we doing here’ look\* \*j-mon replies with ‘this pub is mint’ look\*_

_Oh well R and F-man said this pub had good food specials…lets look at the menu…oh dear_

_What the fuck are we doing in this pub, no f-man I don’t want to go outside in the sun, i’m perfectly happy being miserable in here thanks_
