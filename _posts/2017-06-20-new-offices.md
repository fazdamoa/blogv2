### [New Offices](https://fazthebro.com/2017/06/20/new-offices/)

Due to the loud drilling, we have moved offices, into _Real London!_

Lots of food places, old buildings to see and lots of people. The offices are nice, and only a few floors above the Labour Party. Give us a wave savior Corbyn! We haven’t seen Him yet but we hope He joins us on a 3pm walk sometime.

Here’s the latest pic of our walk last week – visiting Westminster Cathedral. The premier cathedral in London is actually a real piece of shit, the outside is orange brick and the inside is even worse. It looks like there was a fire inside about 200 years ago that never got cleaned out, however they say:

_‘the black ceiling is intentional, as each generation should decorate it with new mosaics’_

Yeah…half a millennium of generations artwork later…don’t bother seeing it.

Clearing the mind and clearing our sin. 3pm walk is a cleansing process.

**Now I know what you are thinking. PHIL? ON THE WALK?**

Yes, you aren’t mistaken, you are still on fazthebro.com and not a scam site. Check the SSL cert if you like.

Fill came down, he seems more relaxed in these new offices (rumour is that he talked to the receptionist and she didn’t initially scowl at him)

So…with fill…was kind of ok? Semi-Brill?

Will keep you posted.
