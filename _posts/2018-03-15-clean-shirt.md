> How many shirts would a clean shirt clean if a clean shirt could clean shirts?

Hi everyone, I’m back! I know it’s been a rather large hiatus. Work has actually been busy – who saw that coming – plus I have so many extra curricular activities I find it hard to make time to update everyone on security.

Anyway, let’s get straight into it – _clean shirt?? Sure, I’m an accountant and I wear one FTB, what gives??_

Clean shirt is a member of staff at my work who always wears crispy clean shirts (suspect his Thai wife has something to do with the quality of the ironing) and is very loud, obnoxious, and annoying. Every day at 8:30 on the dot, he is blasting away about some shit story – if he has exhausted the racist rants about his team that is.

It’s gotten to the point where I don’t want to wear shirts in public anymore, let alone clean ones!

Peep show coined our villians name

I’m sure you all have a ‘clean shirt’ at your work. So the question is, what can I do about it? I’ve tried a few methods, none of which are even having limited success..

*   Talking down to him even though he is in a managerial position
*   Completely ignoring him while he addresses me directly
*   Said ‘have you heard of email cunt?’ when he was yelling his head off to a colleague about different fabric softener brands
*   Worn dirty shirts

Nothing seems to work. The guy thinks he’s super important and is planning the next desk move. Since I am actually important, two guesses where i’ll be sitting…thank god for noise cancelling headphones.

Well watch this space guys…let us know your clean shirt solutions in the comments, and join me in saying…
