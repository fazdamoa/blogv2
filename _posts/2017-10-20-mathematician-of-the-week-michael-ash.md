Welcome back everyone! Today I have a special treat for you – Math-Man of the Week.

_But FTB, we want mongs, not mathematicians!_

Don’t worry, Mong of the week is still going to happen! Anyway, I’m sure you will enjoy this new section as this is very interesting – Michael Ash is arguably one of the most important humans, and certainly the most important mathematician – to have ever lived.

After four years of dedicating his life to his invention, losing his wife, house and life along the way, he finally made it work, and changed the world forever.

1959 began just like any other year.  Alaska became a US state, Fidel Castro arrived in Havana and the Soviets recognized his government.  The first photos of the far side of the moon were taken. None of these will leave a mark in history like Mike’s invention however.

For in 1959, after 258 years of the same recipe, Mike invented a mechanism that could put _Nitrogen_ into Guinness kegs (instead of the usual CO2). This made the Guinness creamy and smooth like you know it today. Nitrogen bubbles are much smaller than CO2, which allows very high pressure on the beer without making it fizzy. This is why you hear the iconic _hiss_ when a Guinness is poured. The nitrogen is also what gives a Guinness its creamy head, and causes the effect of the ‘cream’ settling in the glass.

If you wanted to try Guinness as it was in the original recipe, Foreign Extra Stout is the closest you can get. I’m sure it is just as delicious – though I’ve never had one!

I think you can all join me in saying:

_‘Thank you Mike – thanks to you,  
creamy Guinness is my go-to,  
I’ve never tasted as fine ‘a brew,  
Because you ditched the CO2.__‘_

Some Guinness facts:

*   Although Guinness may appear to be black, it is officially a very dark shade of ruby.
*   Studies claim that Guinness can be beneficial to the heart. Researchers found that “‘antioxidant compounds’ in the Guinness, similar to those found in certain fruits and vegetables, are responsible for the health benefits because they slow down the deposit of harmful cholesterol on the artery walls.
*   Arthur Guinness started brewing ales in 1759 at the St. James’s Gate Brewery, Dublin. On 31 December 1759, he signed a 9,000 year lease at £45 per annum for the unused brewery.
*   “Stout” originally referred to a beer’s strength, but eventually shifted meaning toward body and colour.
*   Originally, Guinness was poured in two stages because it would froth up so much on the first pour, the barman would have to let it settle. This is no longer necessary with the nitrogen Guinness, but the company thought it would ease people into the new recipe if they kept the ritual.
