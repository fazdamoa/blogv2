_Fill: Look how long that line for KFC is…those guys better not get -FUCK what are they doing don’t they have work to do?? Oh right, they just work on that stupid blog…_

NO BUTS, either you come with me now or you are FIRED  
\*Richies silent prayer\* Oh please ftb and jase, forgive me…_

KFC in England is a bit like that girl at a festival…you spent a lot of money, it’s fatty, and you kind of regret it after. Todays meal was 2 pieces of chicken, 4 wings, 2 tenderloins and chips. I think I got about 50g of actual chicken on it. Stick to PFC lads!
