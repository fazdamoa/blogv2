While surfing the web, I often come across interesting quotes by great men, philosophers, economists. One that particularly stood out to me today was this:

Also:

_“Continuous effort – not strength or intelligence – is the key to unlocking our potential.”_

It made me think: this is the true beauty and power of computers. While humans are smart\*, we get frustrated and tired and sick of doing things over and over. Computers will try and fail at a task billions of times, only to re-take it up another billion times with the same enthusiasm.  They can even learn and change their approach along the way.

I think the moral of this story is: how long until I am coded out of my job? Not long I think.

_Edit:_ _The response to this piece has been truly wonderful and I have received some great letters. Reading up on Churchill has really intrigued me to learn more about him, I may write an expose on him next! 🙂_
