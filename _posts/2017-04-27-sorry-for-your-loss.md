The blog was out this afternoon, we suffered a DDOS attack which even Amazon couldn’t front! I hope you all managed without security tips for a few hours.

We are working hard to get Andybot up and running in rocket, so you don’t need to talk to him ever again. Phrases include:

*   right, window
*   its all gone wrong
*   errrrrrrm
*   anyone want a phone?

Plenty of feedback coming in about the chat server – keep it coming in HOT and lets Make The Internet Great Again!
