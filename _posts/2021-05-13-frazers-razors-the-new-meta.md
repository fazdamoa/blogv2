### [Frazer’s Razors – The NEW META?](https://fazthebro.com/2021/05/13/frazers-razors-the-new-meta/)

6 months ago I decided to ditch the ol’ Gillette Mach III and get the cheapest razor I could buy – the BIC 20 pack. Isn’t a razor just a razor? Isn’t stainless steel just stainless steel? Let’s find out.  
  
**Gillette Mach III:**  
– £15 for 8 Blades (handle not included)  
– 3 stainless steel blades  
– £1.8 per blade

**BIC:**  
– £4 for a 20 pack (handles included on each)  
– 3 stainless steel blades  
– 20p per blade  
  
**Harrys (seems popular):**  
– £8 for 4 blades (handle not included)  
– 5 stainless steel blades  
– £2 per blade

So on the face of it, we can see the BIC has the same specs as the Gillette, for a hell of a lot cheaper. The Harrys has 5 blades – but do you really need that many? Theoretically the fewer blades you have the better the shave. There is a reason why professional groomers use a cut-throat single blade.

The BIC triple Razor – for sensitive skin

So, onto the part you are all waiting for: the review! Yes, the BIC provides as good of a shave as any shaver I have used. I have done good time on Gillette fusion 5 blade, the Mach 3, the Mach 2, and the Shick Quattro, so I’ve been around the block. The BIC is as good as any of these for closeness and sharpness. I also found that the razors last just as long as any named brand. A blade is a blade.

However there is one BIG caveat. For my shaving frequency, the shave takes forever. I shave maybe once every 10 days, so the hairs get long. And my electric shaver doesn’t work so I can’t trim before it. The blades seem to be closer together or something on the BICs and hairs get trapped in, which means you are always having to tap it and remove hairs. However, if you shave every day or second day, this issue doesn’t occur. The moisturizing pad on the shavers are actually pretty decent too!

_So, **the verdict:**_

Yes, the BIC blades are as good as any other, but they are especially good for people who shave frequently. I am going to continue using them, as they are so much cheaper. Somehow the blade companies have brainwashed all us suckers into paying 10x their value – just like Weber Q gas canisters…but we will save that for a future post!
