Happy New Year Security Enthusiasts!

New Year, new blog. The team here at fazthebro.com are happy to announce that we have moved our hosting *again*, this time to Cloudflare pages!
This has made our site free, we can actually add new posts, it should be faster etc. Previously, I had a wordpress instance that actually cost money. Then I just archived the whole blog to HTML and served that directly on github pages. This was fine, but we couldn't add any new posts easily! So I've gone to the trouble of converting all of the posts to Jekyll format, which wasn't easy. It is still a bit messy, but bear with us while we iron out the kinks.

Hope you enjoy the new layout, and have a great start to the new year.
