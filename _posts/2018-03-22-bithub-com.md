One of the biggest questions I get from the public – be it as an IT Security researcher or just good friend:

> FTB, first off, just want to say thanks so much for all the IT security tips and tricks. It’s really changed my life. In fact, I’ve decided to call my new born son Azreev in honour of the ‘Prince Azreev’ article!

Oh wait, that wasn’t the question. That was just an average sample of my fan mail. The main _question_ I receive is:

> FTB, what the hell is bitcoin? Everyone is buying it, so I did too. That means i’m smart right?
>

> 
> Bit-Groin, amirite?? HAHAHAH-

I could go on all day about Bitcoin. The tech behind it is fascinating, and fucking cool. But something in the blockchain is currently making headlines from our favourite cryptocurrency:

**Child Porn.**

In the huge blockchain of transactions that make up Bitcoins history – you are allowed to add a message (generally a note about the transaction itself) but of course, this has been abused, as everything that gets exposed to the internet does. Researchers have just found thousands of links to child porn images, and have found at least one full image embedded in the blockchain. So if you have a bitcoin wallet – you probably have kiddie porn on your PC!

Sure the price fell, and its impossible to get rid of these links so – death of blockchain as we know it? I’m sure the regulators are ready to pounce on this one…

Tip of the day: If you find something like this in another currency, make sure you sell it and short it _before_ messaging the New York Times!

FTB OUT.
