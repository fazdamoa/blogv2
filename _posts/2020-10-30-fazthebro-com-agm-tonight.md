### [Fazthebro.com AGM Tonight!](https://fazthebro.com/2020/10/30/fazthebro-com-agm-tonight/)

Hi readers,

Exciting news for all!

Tonight is the fazthebro.com Annual General Meeting, where we discuss the year in retrospect, plans for the future, and the IT security sector in general. I think we can all say it has been a hell of a year for bad or for worse, but the blog has kept running and helping spirits in these tough times.

The AGM will be held in a Fullers pub, as they have been considering sponsorship of the blog ever since the Michael Ash post (more on this later!) – definitely has nothing to do with the free pint offer today.

**In attendance:**

**J Taylor** – Chairman of the board (to provide the minutes shortly)

**F Davidson –** Founder, CEO and IT helpdesk support

**R Mccoy** (Zoom) – Financial Controller and Blog Contributor

**H Boyd** – Sales Director and Home Security Specialist

**D Brewer** – Risk & Portfolio manager and Foreign Liaison (Albanian Division)

**D Cumins** – Chief Legal and Illegal Counsel

**M O’Byrne** – Accounts

As with any AGM or official fazthebro.com event, all are welcome. Come down and make your voice heard!
