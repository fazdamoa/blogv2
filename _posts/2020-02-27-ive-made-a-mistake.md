Google cloud is fucking expensive!

The month of January cost £48 for this blog! Can you believe that? I know hard-hitting journalism isn’t free, but cmon Google you are trying to get in the cloud game – look out for the little guy!

A load balancer with one forwarding rule is £14 minimum. Just to sit there. Per month. Before tax. This is free in Azure.

The (1 core, 3.5gb ram) Server was over £20! Fucking criminal!

Needless to say, I have moved port to a free Azure subscription, we are back in Kubernetes, with a (2 core 4gb ram) VM, the whole exact same solution costing…

£15 per month. Which I plan to reduce with some trickery.

Lets not even talk about AWS…just to have the ‘right’ to have a Kubernetes cluster costs £160 per month…without any compute.

It really speaks to how good the team at FTB is that we can replatform the whole site to a new cloud in under 20 minutes without any DR planning – or even an Azure subscription.

Moral of the story is: Azure going to win the cloud wars!
