If your Ryanair flight was 3 hours late or more, you are entitled to compensation. (Unless it was due to weather)

*   250 Euros if the distance is 1500km or less
*   400 Euros if it is more than 1500km

Send them your bank details, they have to do it, don’t accept their bullshit excuses. Unless its weather, they have to pay you. In cash. Don’t accept Ryanair credit.

Their ‘new’ random seating algorithm doesn’t seat you together anymore – since July 2017. In fact it forces you to sit apart unless you pay. I had a flight where there was an empty seat next to me, but on the same booking we were put on opposite sides of the plane. So fuck those cunts.

Hate Ryanair.
