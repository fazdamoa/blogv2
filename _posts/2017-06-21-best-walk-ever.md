### [Best Walk Ever?](https://fazthebro.com/2017/06/21/best-walk-ever/)

As I am surrounded by sirens awaiting the Queens speech, I thought I would do a quick update. Before I get to what you are all waiting for – the walk – I’m happy to announce that fazthebro.com is back on http/2! Also, the frequent crashes hopefully shouldn’t be happening anymore: I fixed a bug in the rocketchat server that was leaking memory. A.k.a: STOP SENDING SO MUCH FAN MAIL! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Yesterday’s 3pm walk took us around markets, protests, churches, MI6, Westminster and beyond. Was really top notch. We were with fill, and he actually made it kinda brill, filling us up with his knowledge of the area. Sorry Jase!

Anyway, top highlight for me was definitely the Jewel house, a hidden _gem_ across the road from parliament. Made in the 1300’s, its a pretty cool wee building:

Excuse me, can you take a photo of us? Err sure, but big ben is that way…

Next we moved on to Westminster abbey – Richie has never seen it!

Entry to the abbey is £22 for Adults

Hope you enjoyed this review, and remember, stay safe on the internet!
