Aren’t they the best in the world? You might step on one in the dark and it proper knacks, but that’s just another sign that it’s a sturdy plug!

Have you ever been to the continent with those scary 2 prong things that just plug into live sockets and sometimes they crackle? They scare the shit out of me. Most of them don’t even have switches to turn them on and off before you stick your fingers there to pull the plug out.

Power surge? The fuse in the plug blows instead of your TV!

Kid trying to stick things in the plug? No worries, you need something plugged into the earth socket before it opens the slots for the actual live parts of the circuit. How bloody good is that?

Also, do kids in other countries learn the beauty of how to wire a plug and change a fuse?

How good are British plugs?
