Right, straight into it – Finsbury Park Station is becoming _even_ _better._

Opening in the next few months are new state-of-the-art Thameslink Trains, connecting from Finsbury to Brighton. This includes stops at KCSP, Blackfriars, AND Gatwick!

The line is using new tunnels in an effort to stop congestion of people doing the Vic – Northern Bank branch route. In just 14 years the amount of people using this route has increased 70%.! 8 Trains an hour will run, and there will even be an app that tells you the status of the train, which carriages have seats available, among many other cool things.

So now Finsbury Park has the bullet, PFC, Rowans, BoF, plus direct trains to Stansted, Gatwick AND Heathrow! Southern Fairys – how about you move back to London?

Stay tuned for more security tips! FTB out.
