Quick tip for the day – not security related but I’m sure you all will cope.

30mbps – may be slow for streaming in HD in peak time.

50mbps – a nice sweet spot

76mbps – fast and affordable

Go with Vodafone for home broadband. It’s 76, same price as any competitor and they only offer 50. No landline included which is what you want.
