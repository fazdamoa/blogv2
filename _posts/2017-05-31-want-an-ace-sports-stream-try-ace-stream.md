These pesky sports rights holders are making their coverage more and more expensive. Who can afford to buy a whole sky package so you can watch (some) of the premier league? Don’t play NBA in your town? Look no further.

_Enter [Ace Stream](http://acestream.org/)._

App for Android, and available on PC, this streaming engine connects you with other users in P2P (like torrents) and provides an ad-free HD experience. It is in beta, I have used it a few times and it is OK. The more popular the sport is the more stable it is, but the quality is fantastic and is safe to use.

You connect using an Ace Stream link, which is best found on Reddit. I have successfully used it for premier league and All Blacks matches. Once up, I just cast it to the TV with _Chromecast._
