Hi P,

Iâ€™m currently sitting here, celebrating a triumph â€“ we got an AWS Lambda instance to resize images on the fly when people want different sizes. But anyway, donâ€™t want to get you too into that ðŸ˜‰

Answer: Three or Vodafone.

Need a phone?Â Go with Vodafone. They give you an iPhone 7 or Galaxy S7 + good data allowance for Â£30-35 a month. (And have a good network)

BYO phone? Iâ€™d go with Three. 12gb data for Â£20 a month. Service is average though. You also get free data in 20 countries!

UPDATE:

Vodafone have a flash deal now for 12 months sim-only contract. Â£20, 20gb data, free roaming in all of Europe. Get on it!
