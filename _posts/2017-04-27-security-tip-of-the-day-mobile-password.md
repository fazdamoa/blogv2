A mobile password is something that everyone should have, period. Everyone has something to hide, and your phone is likely connected to almost all of them.

If you lose your phone, or it is stolen, (thanks Finsbury Park scooter guys) you want to make sure that they cannot access any of your data, which is far more important than the hardware itself. Access to your email is access to everything, and even if you think you have nothing of worth, a stolen identity is far too common to ignore.

1\. Thumbprint

The thumbprint is the most convenient way to open your phone, and is relatively secure. It won‚Äôt stop the CIA or a determined individual from accessing your accounts, but it will thwart a casual mugger or a lost phone.

2\. Pin Code + Erase Data

This is one of the most important ‚Äì a Pin code on a reboot, and a maximum number of tries before the phone wipes itself. This CAN beat the govt departments, as shown by Apple v FBI last year. Remember, ‚ÄúIf the cops come knockin‚Äô you better start lockin'‚Äù ‚Äì turn your phone off if you ever think you are going to be arrested. On a reboot, the phone requires a pin entry, not thumb, and they can‚Äôt force you to give the password.

3\. Encryption

Encrypt everything on your phone. It‚Äôs normally the default. If you don‚Äôt, anyone can access your nudes by just plugging the phone into a computer.

Hope you enjoyed tip of the day, and keep tuned for more updates üôÇ
