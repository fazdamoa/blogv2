### [Le Tourists](https://fazthebro.com/2017/05/24/le-tourists/)

We went and did it guys…got a photo at Peggy Porschen.

A cake/coffee place near work, it is pink, expensive, and always in the shade. This of course is a great combination for any hipster, and undoubtedly we find it full every time we walk past. Sitting outside on the hard ‘vintage’ chairs while it’s 8 degrees and raining, and not getting away for under a tenner, is a must do in London.

Every 3pm walk we go past here, we see a token Asian table, a rich mum with her baby, and a couple where the man looks like he’d wish he was anywhere else! Anyway, here’s the pic:
