I’m looking for a cherry brown mechanical if possible…

Bae apparently ‘can’t sleep’ with the click sound of my cherry MX blue keyswitches. (Razer Blackwidow Pro)

I thought you would sleep like a baby to the soothing clicks of ADADAD while I yell:

“Fucking noobs! He’s window room! WINDOW ROOM! ”

I guess it’s not for everyone.
