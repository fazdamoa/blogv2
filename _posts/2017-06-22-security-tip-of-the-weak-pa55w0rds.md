See what I did there? Probably not.

Passwords. We all have â€™em, we all need â€™em, and we all use the same one everywhere\*. Well, maybe except for your banking. That one isÂ _goooood._ Amirite?

### So what is a good password?

A good password is something a person with good knowledge about you couldnâ€™t guess, and is long enough that a computer canâ€™t crack it. Thatâ€™s about it!

### Errâ€¦shouldnâ€™t I be using upper and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and undiscovered hieroglyphs in it?

Sure, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, and it sure makes it hard for a human to guess. But if it is so complex that you have to write it down, it basically defeats the purpose.

_Mongs at my work who have it taped to their keyboard! Read this!_

Password complexity is pretty bollocks in my opinion, it makes passwords hard for humans to remember and easy for computers to guess (they donâ€™t care about the letters really, only length, unless it is a purely dictionary based attack). Also, once you have a â€˜goodâ€™ password, you are likely to use it in multiple places.

**Enter: Password Managers.**

A password manager is a bit of software for your PC and Phone, which uses one â€˜masterâ€™ password to unlock, and then stores different passwords for you for each website. That way, if a site gets hacked, they only get the random password you used for that site. Check out Lastpass. Iâ€™ve even seen guys who just type in random shit into a sign up page, because they know they wonâ€™t use the account again. If you need it, use the forgot password link.

Most important, have a good password for banking and email. And remember to 2 factor all the things!!!!!
