Hi Abdulla,

Thanks for the support, really appreciate it. Currently I’m sitting here learning very quickly why failover clustering over VPN and different subnets is a bad idea…but more on that later!

Good question! I’ll try to keep it as brief as possible – while going a bit in depth. For reference, i’m using a Galaxy S7 (thanks Trandy) and it’s a fucking awesome phone.

**Document Scanner – Office Lens**

If you haven’t tried this app out, trust me, it’s fucking awesome. It turns your camera into a document scanner. It doesn’t matter what angle you take the picture, it will straighten it out like you have scanned it. Made by MSFT.  
I have used it to send official documents to Czech/London embassy, and they accepted them, even though they need legit scans. Really recommend.

**Cloud Storage – Google Drive**

Previously I used _Dropbox_ with the 15gb they give you with a Samsung. Dropbox is fine, but I found it to be super expensive (paid options are 30gb, or 1TB as the next hop – I don’t need that much!)  
Google drive gives a nice price ~$2.99 a month for 100gb storage. I make sure I backup all my photos here in full quality, as the free version compresses them. (Although I have heard the compression method is very good)

**Web Browser – Samsung Internet**

“WHATTT?? WHY NOT CHROME?? HGSHKJNHDSG”

That’s right, I use Samsungs stock browser. I personally find it fast, slick, and lightweight. Chrome became a super hungry best for me, and my battery life has increased dramatically. Plus you can install an ad-blocker, use fingerprint for passwords stored in Knox. Give it a try if you can!

**Weather – Yahoo!**

I! know! I’ll! get! laughed! at! for! this! one!  
It has the most no-nonsense interface for me. No clicks or swipes required. Awful for NZ but good for London.

**Keyboard – Swiftkey**

I like to have all my numbers and punctuation on one screen. Can’t be bothered doing a pointless click on the ‘123’ button.

**Other fun apps:**

*   Skymap – Map the night sky
*   File Manager
*   Duolingo
*   Colornote

Hope that satisfies your APPetite!

Cheers,

FTB
