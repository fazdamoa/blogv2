Hi everyone, long time no post (as usual)

Today we have a rather unusual post for the blog. No mentions of IT security whatsoever. You may stop reading here if you just want securitips!

Today we are talking about art. Art is everywhere you look. In the galleries. In sports. In your cable management. Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time. It evokes our emotions, moves us, and takes a snapshot of history forever more.

Sometimes, an artist comes along who doesn’t just move people, but creates a movement. He inspires and educates. He changes the world.

This artist I am talking about is of course:  _John Gilroy._

Born in Whitley bay, John  casually started out life as a war hero in WW1. Like all artists, he started out as an amateur, not much recognition. But then he got a job in advertising, and took the world by storm.

John Gilroy is the man behind ‘My Goodness, my Guinness’, ‘Guinness is good for you’ and every other Guinness ad from 1928 – 1960.

Artist and poet.

Bet you feel like a Guinness right about now?

So please dear readers, next time you pick up that delicious creamy pint of the black stuff, take a moment to appreciate the artists – who carried Guinness through time, found the perfect mix of ingredients, designed the keg and piping system. Hell take a moment to thank Michael Ash for the nitrogen he added to it. You owe them.
