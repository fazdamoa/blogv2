Hi everyone, and welcome back to the hit series: _FTBs MIQ!_

Surprisingly, stuck in a room for the whole day doesnâ€™t give you as much free time as you like. I havenâ€™t found time to write the blog, so Iâ€™m packing in a couple days here as they are all basically the same. With a gaming laptop and a good internet connection and 0 guilt about playing gamesâ€¦well.

**Day 1**

We have been set into a small â€˜groupâ€™ who gets our Covid tests done together. Got a covid test. The meals arenâ€™t terrible, just bang average.

Americas Cup is on, and all everyone is talking about. Tune in on the 4K TV â€“ not bad reception. The â€˜expertâ€™ panel cracks me up. Everyone but Dean Barker doesnâ€™t look like theyâ€™ve been on a boat before in their life â€“ except for the dude who may have arrived on one.

**Day 2**

We have gotten a blue band and are allowed out! There is a walking track that you can book. It is a 4:35 round trip walking. 40 mins I did a bit over 5k steps.

So far have basically just played a ton of Warzone! The aussie servers arenâ€™t great, a lot of problems with ping and crashes and packet loss â€“ a mate commented he had a bit of packet loss in London as well ðŸ˜›

The death comms are the best thing about Aussie servers. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve been called a faggot more in my life outside a session with Pmac and Camby.

**Day 3**

On my daily walk. A cougar is walking the track. Mid forties, blonde, probably does a good amount of yoga. After a couple laps she has made friends with a big young Fijian dude walking the track in Jandals. They now walking together which Iâ€™m not sure is allowed. Wonder what will happen there!

**Day 4**

WARZONE WIN! Finally we won a bloody game of Warzone. Rusty, my â€˜friendâ€™ from the MIQ page who also is in isolation have been playing about 7 hours a day. The lack of wins was getting a bit rediculous. When the doctor here calls me for the â€˜daily mental health checkâ€™ during a game I just want to say â€˜ I play a game for 7 hours a day and Iâ€™m still shit. How do you think Iâ€™m fuckin feeling?â€™

Fucked up a deployment at work. Made a change without telling anyone and probably in trouble. Probably shouldnâ€™t do prod deployments while 1. Jetlagged 2. Boozed and 3. Playing Warzone at the same timeâ€¦

Game of CS with the kiwi boys! We won one and lost one. I played terrible. But Sloan and the boys keep the spirits high.

**Day 5**

NZ wins Americas Cup. Well done. The commentary is so biased it almost seems self aware. When NZ in front: â€˜Emirates Team New Zealand are playing it brilliantly, excellent move there, the lead is mountingâ€™  
When Italy regains the lead: â€˜Looks like the race is in natureâ€™s hands at the momentâ€™

**Tech Specs:**

Warzone Games: 70 (fuck me)  
Warzone Wins: 2  
Good Meal ratio: 4/16  
Tugs: 11
