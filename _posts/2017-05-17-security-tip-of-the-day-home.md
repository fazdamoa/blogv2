By now, you have followed the blog, and religiously followed the tips and tricks to keep your IT bubble safe. I say religiously because Jesus, you followers are like a cult! Appreciate the support!

Something we talk less about though, is your home security. How can you up the game there? As we know, physical access to any machine is basically game over. Take a look at the Riversdale door lock:

Attempted break in at the River

Notice the crowbar marks on the door. The reprobates that attempted this break in clearly didn’t see the swag of our Banham™ lock! Even so, they didn’t get in because of one simple thing:

**_We lock our door._**

78% of London homes aren’t locked. They just shut the door behind them, and hope that keeps it closed. Most people aren’t even aware you can lock the door after closing. If you just close it behind you, a cordless drill can go through the wood, and press the latch. Open sesame!

Keep that door locked team, especially on weekends. Give the robbers the same disappointment their mothers have for them.
