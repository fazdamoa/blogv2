Hello followers!

New year, new company, new platform. The blog is back online after over a year!

Why offline for so long you ask? Well, AWS gives a free tier of servers for a year. After a year and a bit, I started realizing that keeping a blog running without ads isn’t free, and had to pull the pin. I want to give the best experience for all of you, so instead of putting ads on the blog I just decided to shut down in protest.

So why am I back? Good news, Google Cloud Platform offers £200 in free hosting, so I’m gonna be back for a while! And once again, our tech stack is completely different!

Dear readers, our journey has taken us from our humble beginnings – a single Amazon server, 1gb ram, 0.5 cores with NGINX installed – to a 2gb ram / 1 core Docker host – we are now at the pinnacle of blog power…

Master forgive me…but we now have…

TWO 8gb ram / 2 core hosts running KUBERNETES behind Cloudflare!

We have auto deployment, helm registry, istio, Lets encrypt with ACME – jesus this tech stack is a recruiters wet dream.

For all the noobs out there, this basically means the blog should go down less than it used to (that was about every day)

In other news, I had a letter recently from David Hills asking why the blog now sends updates to his spam box in his email. Good question David!

See you in the next one.
