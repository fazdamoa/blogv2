*   Lake Superior has 10% of all the fresh water _in the world_.
*   Jurassic Park was released closer to the Moon landing than to the present day.
*   It took 4 times longer for man to go from bronze swords to iron swords than iron swords to nuclear weapons.
*   When they first calculated the height of mount everest they decided to add a couple feet because they figured nobody would believe that it was exactly 29,000ft.

> “Peak XV (measured in feet) was calculated to be exactly 29,000 ft (8,839.2 m) high, but was publicly declared to be 29,002 ft (8,839.8 m) in order to avoid the impression that an exact height of 29,000 feet (8,839.2 m) was nothing more than a rounded estimate.”

*   Oxford University is older than the Aztec Empire
*   The U.S. spends more on its military defense budget than the next seven countries combined.
