This is for all you planespotters – we have a new Boeing and Airbus.

New 787!  Check out this:

> The 787-10 is the biggest variant of the 787, also known as the “Dreamliner”. The plane boasts the same 60m wingspan and 574cm cross-section as the 787-8 and 787-9, but at 68m is five metres longer than the 787-9 and can therefore pack in about 38 extra passengers in Boeing’s recommended configurations.

7 passengers per meter? Clearly not for the American Market. Or Italian. (Italian children are the most obese in the world!)

Also a smaller version of the Airbus A320, the A319 is here. Not very exciting to be honest. However, it is the first Airbus to not use Rolls Royce engines…interesting.

Coming up:

The Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, thinks it can get a single-aisled 160-seater into the air in mid-2017. Japan’s Mitsubishi is working on 88-and-76-seater jets, but has delayed their planned entry to service from 2018 to 2020 as it wrestles electrical issues.

Jappa engineering having reliability problems? Surely not. Hopefully the interior is done by Jan Beck.
