If your movie isn’t on Netflix and you can’t afford a subscription to anything else, what do you do?

Probably head to _thepiratebay_.

There are always risks with downloading from strangers on the internet, however installing apps like netflix, hulu, sky etc also come with their own bloat and adware. Here are my tips for safe stealing searching:

*   For movies, use https://yts.ag/ wherever possible. These are YIFY movies direct from him, are generally safe, high quality, with fast downloads. (also has subtitles if you have a continental gf)
*   Use UTorrent as your client. Most secure, fastest and lightweight there is.
*   Be an asshole. Don’t seed for 1 second longer than it takes to download. 99% of piracy notices come from SEEDING not LEECHING.
*   Check the comments/amount of seeders/’trusted’ users if you are unsure.

Stay tuned for more security tips and stay safe!
