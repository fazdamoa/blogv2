We’ve all been through it – Bae: _“Send me the photos from yesterday. Rapido, adelente, ahora!”_

You open up Whatsapp, select every photo and it’s 4 identical copies, and send multiple 12mb images that are somehow now 10kb.

Why are they so compressed? Because Whatsapp likes to save bandwidth and compresses the shit out of your images and videos. That’s why they always look pretty average on the other end, and can’t be printed out. Take this one shot of the blog on an iPhone 11 for example:

Why??

Oh wait, that was actually before it was compressed. haha. iPhone. Amirite?

_So FTB, how should I be sending photos in good quality? iPhone and Android don’t really mix with device sharing…_

If you aren’t using it already, and are happy to sell your soul to Google, download _Google Photos._ It is fantastic, and certified mint by FTB. They offer unlimited backups for free of photos, all tied into your gmail account, and it is available on IOS and Android!

The photos are compressed with Googles algo – which is surprisingly indistinguishable from original quality – kind of has to be seen to be believed…

Once your photos are in the app, you can share them via a cloud album, or just start a ‘chat’ with someone else and add them in there, just like Whatsapp.

Let me know in the comments if you want more tips like this!
