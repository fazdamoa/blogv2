Why do we still have our shitty flag? Oh, because you didn’t vote.

Voting time guys, it’s pretty easy to do from the UK, and if we are going to get Winnie into power we have to vote.

1.  Download your documents [here](https://enrol.elections.org.nz/app/dvp/#/). They are personalised, you have to enter your name address and DOB, so I can’t have a direct DL for you.
2.  Print out the bastards, fill em in, get a witness (doesn’t have to be from NZ) to sign it as well.
3.  (Optional) Tick the boxes for Winston and NZ First.

Now, you have to scan them and upload them to the site. Don’t have a scanner? Neither do I. As my readers will know, there is an app for this, called _Office Lens_ that can ‘scan’ documents using your smartphone.

1.  Scan all the pages using Office Lens.
2.  Move them to Google drive/Dropbox/FTBox
3.  Upload the files [here](https://uvp.elections.govt.nz/).

Done! You are now a happy voter, and are allowed to complain about shit Government! Enjoy a moment of accomplishment, and smile.
