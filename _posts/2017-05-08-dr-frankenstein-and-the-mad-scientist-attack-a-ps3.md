Turned on Henry’s ps3 for the first time in a few years. The old girl was looking promising – but then crashed after about 15 minutes on God of War 3. Being the IT nuts we are, James and I decided to help Henry out and take her apart to clean out the fans. (suspected overheating)

Sorry Henry, your ps3 doesn’t boot anymore

RIP ??
