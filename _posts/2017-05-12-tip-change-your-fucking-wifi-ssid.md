### [Tip: Change your fucking WiFi SSID](https://fazthebro.com/2017/05/12/tip-change-your-fucking-wifi-ssid/)

The amount of times I go to peoples houses and ask for the wifi details…

_“Oh its name is voda-12aec5 and the password is in our flat chat…hold on I’ll try find it…_  
_Yep found it so the password is 36c88d6ccb”_

It almost infuriates me as much as waiting in a Finsbury Park self-checkout line. (Mongs)

When you are on your wifi, in most cases, just type in 192.168.1.1 into your phones browser. It will be written on the router which number to put in. From there, use the username and password provided on the router. Now you get an easy webpage to change the name and password! It takes about 1 minute.

Go the Black Caps!
