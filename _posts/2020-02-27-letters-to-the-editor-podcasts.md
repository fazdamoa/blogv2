This week we have a letter from G. Bod, his question:

_FTB, thanks so much for this blog, it is incredibly well written, sometimes moving, and has saved me from the internet bad guys countless times. Anyway my question – I really love broadening my horizons and learning about things other than accounting. What are some interesting podcasts you like that I can listen to?_

I know what you are thinking dear readers: this is the guy who thought that South America speaks Spanish by coincidence – and who puts frozen chicken in the rice cooker – surely this question is made up. Well I think it’s great you want to broaden those horizons G!

This is a quick overview over a range of topics that I enjoyed and think are important. I am including youtube links but only including ones that are on Apple/Spotify/Podcast Addict too (use this app you mongs)

### 1\. Peter Thiel x Eric Weinstein

This would be my must listen podcast. Thiel and Weinstein are extremely intelligent and know a range of issues, mainly to do with growth of industry, science and economy. They go over topics like ‘has the economy actually grown since the 70s?’ ‘What technological progress has happened outside the world of bits?’ ‘Why is physics/quantum physics study not bringing any real-world applications?’ ‘Where are the self driving cars and cancer cures?’

They also discuss what university has become and how shit it is. Might do an expose on that topic.

It’s really good.

### 2\. Joe Rogan x Brian Cox

If you like astronomy and space, this podcast is a great taster. Rogan is pretty dumb, so keeps the conversation light and interesting. They go over topics like black holes, gravity, aliens, recent discoveries in astronomy and physics. Brian Cox is a great entertainer and really engaging for being a bit of a beta.

### 3\. Joe Rogan x Ceara Lynch

This girl shits in bags and sells them to guys on the internet. Enough said.

I’ve got plenty more where these came from, especially in the science and astronomy areas. Let us know if you want more in the comments G!

Podcasts to avoid:

*   Freakonomics radio
*   Philosophize this!

Hope this answered your question G!

Cheers, FTB
