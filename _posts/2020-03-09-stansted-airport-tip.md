Finally got to measure my hunch last night at Stansted Airport. When lining up for E-Passport gates, always take the LEFT hand lane.

The left line has almost twice as many machines as the right hand line, and the line is actually shorter. I measured this by tracking a guy next to me who took the right hand line – I would estimate him to be at least 10 minutes behind me as I went through.

Also, if it says ‘seek assistance’ just exit, re-enter and try again. And then try a different line if it doesn’t work. Just like computing, turning it off and on again works!
