> Dear FTB, I love the blog, but I find it kind of light on actual security tips. Isnâ€™t this meant to be about IT?
> 
> â€“ P. Mac. ChCh, NZ

**Hi P,**

**Yes, this is predominantly an IT security blog, and I am glad you are enjoying it. I admit â€“ some fluff can fall through the cracks, but what is work without a little play? ðŸ™‚**

**Go fuck yourself.**

**Regards,**

**FTB**
