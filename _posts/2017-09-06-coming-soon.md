### [NEW RIG!](https://fazthebro.com/2017/09/06/coming-soon/)

Welcome to the build of my new PC!

I found on Gumtree a Romanian guy selling 16gb of DDR4 ram + a Ryzen 5 1600 for £200. All brand new and sealed. The CPU alone is worth this, and the mem almost as much. Probably fell off a lorry. Needless to say, I had to upgrade my rig…

2x Corsair Vengeance 8gb DDR4 3200mhz Memory  
Ryzen 5 1600 3.2ghz/6 cores  
MSI GTX 1080 Gaming X +  
EVGA G3 550w GOLD PSU  
Fractal Design Mini C MicroATX Windowed Case  
MSI B350 Gaming Pro motherboard

Got the Ryzen OC at 3.8ghz on the stock cooler, pretty impressive in this small case. Also got the GPU up to 2000mhz.

Not bad, but not as amazing at 1080p as I thought. The Witcher 3 getting around 80-100fps on max, and BF1 somehow getting 120fps.

CS pretty solid at 300 on Mirage.

Time to upgrade, friends?

Finished cabling. Was happy with how tidy I could get it!

It’s so easy when you know how. It’s like lego, just follow the instructions!
