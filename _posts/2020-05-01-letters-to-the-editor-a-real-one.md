Hi everyone, today I have a letter sent in by one of our most avid young readers, Cameron Olliver! I’ll post it below, but first can I please say thanks Cameron for all the support over the years. You have kept the comment section really busy and we couldn’t have done all the technical and emotional support at ftb.com without you!

Camerons letter:

> A fella named Jackie once said; “A life is not important, except in the impact it has on other lives”. That could be bullshit, but it rings true for a blog. And this blog, comparable to Jackie being the first black man to play baseball in the major leagues, is the first IT security blog to hit the big time. Just like Jackie gave it to the Yankees in 1955, FTB security is giving it to the knobs of Silicon Valley.
> 
> If that didn’t act like a blue pill for your purple headed yogurt slinger, then hopefully some points on how Fazthebro and FTB IT Security changed my life;
> 
> *   (May 21, 2017)
> *   Apps on apps. Helped me change the way I used the cell.
> *   (June 12, 2017) I traded cereal for eggs and avocado on toast! This is a hell of an IT security ploy. Feed the brain, become more alert, don’t click on dumb shit that will give you a virus.
> *   (July 5, 2017) Got a fidget spinner.
> *   (August 22, 2017) I learnt how to get a big compo payout. Who knew it was good to fly with a shit airline.
> *   (September 21, 2017) I learnt to vote in NZ. Waste of time though with the lefty pricks getting in without the popular vote.
> 
> Thanks to Fazthebro for being that solid voice amongst the crap that the internet dishes up. Please keep enlightening us all. May you go down as the Jackie Robinson of the IT security world – the first Slav to the top.

…I’m not crying, you’re crying.
