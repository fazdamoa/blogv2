Did you know that within the first 6 months of Britain entering the great war, Germany already had bombers flying over London?

In fact, the first bomb dropped on London was near the River, in Stoke Newington. As the German Kaiser and the British King were cousins, the Kaiser ordered incendiary bombs to be dropped only on the outskirts of London (North London and East, mainly) but there were also a few dropped on South London (Pimlico) and even South England (Clapham)!

These big balls of Hydrogen could carry 6 gunners, 2 being stationed on the top of the balloon, and enough bombs to light up about 5 houses. Once the war became more intense over time, the Kaiser ordered Central London to be bombed also – but try not hit the landmarks!

The Zeppelins were launched from Belgium, and as such, they could be blown away with a small amount of wind. In fact, many were shot down this way, as they couldn’t get home quick enough to outrun the RAF.
