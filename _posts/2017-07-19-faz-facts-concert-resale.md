Jumping on to Viagogo today to have a look at the resale price of Blink-182 tickets in London tonight…was no small thing!

Look at this shit while ‘searching’ for tickets:

Only 80 tickets left! (At this point in time)

Not only does this look like a fake loading screen to scare you into buying, but it seems to have all false information. 23 other people viewing event? Sure, probably true. Only 80 tickets left? Bullshit. They get added frequently throughout the day. Less than 1% of tickets left for event? Completely false. Seated tickets are still on official sale, none have sold out.

Who woulda thunk Blink 182 is a popular choice in 2017?

> But FTB, I love Viagogo, they provide a good service for real fans who can’t get tickets on sale day, and don’t mind paying a bit more, right?

Kind of. They do this, and also help others for when people suddenly can’t  make the concert. However sites like this are prime for scalpers to take advantage, which they do. But hey, that’s fine, because they are still letting the real fans get tickets after sale. So what’s the real problem?

_Viagogo are the scalpers._

A huge chunk of official Ticketmaster/Axs tickets get bought up by Viagogo and other reselling sites (sometimes as high as 40%) as soon as they are released. This guarantees selling out, and they make huge money off the mark-up, sometimes even having tickets not sell and expire. Viagogo literally just takes the money from the artist – as they agree to the official sale price.

Ticketmaster saw this happening – and obviously thought it was unfair. So like any company that cares for its customers, they made tickets ID only, and non-transferable. Just kidding.

**Ticketmaster opened their own ticket reseller.** Now when a concert goes on sale, Ticketmaster buys tickets from itself  (ahead in the queue of the other resellers) and sells them for premiums on a reselling site it owns.

Fucking scumbags.
