Is it?

Hi all, back again with another security tip of the day (can’t really be bothered making too many more of these, so enjoy while it lasts)

AntiVirus. Everyone gets pissed off by it, but everyone needs it.

**OR DO THEY?**

Personally, I don’t run any extra antivirus applications on my devices other than out of the box. User knowledge and common sense is far greater than anything an AntiVirus can give you. This is because by its very nature, viruses are ahead of AntiVirus, _all the time._

With Windows, the best thing you can do is get to Windows 10, always do Windows updates, and turn on Windows defender. It’s actually pretty good. Don’t download stupid shit from the internet. Use a separate admin user and logged-in user. It’s that easy.

**Never pay for antivirus. Defender is just as good if you aren’t retarded.**

Apps like Norton actually feel like a virus; they slow down your computer, and have been known to ADD vulnerabilities, so why use them? Maybe you have to for work. If you must, a good lightweight option is bitdefender free:

**IOS/Android:**

Never get antivirus, ever. Your phone is much better than anything you can download. All apps run in a sandbox, so the app can’t even access anything else on the phone. It will slow it down and do nothing.

**MAC:**

Sell that POS and get off the blog.

Friday 5pm – that’s about it for today, beer time!!
