Today on my daily exercise I noticed that all of the cafes are open in Highbury, selling takeaway coffee and croissants.

I saw big lines of people, all standing two meters apart, waiting to get their fix.

Not only are people still paying over 3 quid for a coffee, but they are fucking _queuing_ for 30 minutes to get it.

Why can’t they open pubs for takeaway Guinness?? FFS I can make a coffee at home. The Guinness cans just aren’t in the same universe, let alone the same level as one from the keg.

Thanks for tuning in to this weeks security tips!
