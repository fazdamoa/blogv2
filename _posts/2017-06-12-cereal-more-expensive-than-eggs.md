Since when was it cheaper to have eggs and avocado on toast for breakfast than cereal?

£5 just got me 1 loaf of tescos finest brown bread, 12 free-range eggs and 2 large avocados. That’s 4 brekkies.

Hard to get any cereal but weetabix for under 3 quid, and you’d be lucky to get 4 brekkies out of it. Plus £1 for the milk!

There’s big demand for me to upload my 3 minute avo eggs & toast method. Will do soon!
