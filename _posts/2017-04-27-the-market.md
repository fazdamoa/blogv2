Every Thursday we head down to the market for a market, which is a good 15 minute walk from the office (lunch break is 30 mins)

They have epic kebabs for £4.50 that are almost too big to eat. Plus we get to see all of our mates down there. From left to right in the photo there is:

*   Good meat guy
*   All salads yes
*   Halloumi guy

Today ‘All salads yes’ looked really down in the dumps, our thoughts are with him and his troubles he must be having. Surely he can’t be sick of his job. To every cloud there is a silver lining however, because of his sadness, he actually wrapped the kebab properly!

Cheers to the team at the market for their epic hospitality.
