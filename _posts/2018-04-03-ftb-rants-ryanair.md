Whether you love ’em or hate ’em, chances are, you aren’t a part of the ‘95% of flights are on time!’

Welcome back to another edition of FTB rants, where we talk all things security, IT, and everything in between. Today’s victim, the future #1 most hated company in Europe, RyanAir.

There are many reasons to dislike RyanAir, the largest (and saddest) is the destruction of Europe’s best destinations with tourists. Flights can be so cheap now, the ‘RyanAir effect’ has every weekend of the year flooding beautiful places like Prague, Venice, Barcelona with mongs and lager-louts – where it used to be reserved for nice, cultured, unassuming, well dressed rich people!

The main problem I want to discuss today however, is the seating algorithm. over 6 Months ago, I posted about why I hate RyanAir, because the seating algorithm seemed to have changed. You used to get put together if you were on the same booking, but overnight it seemed randomly allocated. RyanAir was called out at the time, to which they responded:

> We have not changed our seating algorithm at all. It is random, as it always has been.

Bullshit.

I recently went to Portugal with bae, and paid £220 for my flight. So cheap, I know. When going to check in, the site said:  
‘warning, you are not sitting together! Upgrade for £8.’  
I’m not the kind of guy to have 8 bucks lying around, so voila, we were sitting apart. Me in row 31, her in row 4.

The lady next to me asked if I could switch with her husband, who was in the row in front. She was in the middle, and so was he, so I didn’t want to give up my aisle seat. Now here’s the kicker – the seat next to her was _empty._ The husband just got up and moved. Also, the seat next to bae was empty. And the son of this couple was the seat over from that, next to bae!

After take-off, everyone is getting up and moving seats due to this bullshit.

The algorithm basically is this: You will be seated in a middle seat  by default – unless you sitting there means that you get to sit next to your partner (or enable another couple to sit next to each other). It will also try to put you as far from your partner as possible. I saw a woman get allocated a middle seat, when she was the only person in a row.

So how do you win? Just check in as late as possible. Like in the last 10 minutes. You will get the emergency exit row, as they save these for last in case anyone pays for them. You will also get a chance of sitting next to your partner this way. PLUS they reserve space for your bag!

Fuck RyanAir. FTB out.
