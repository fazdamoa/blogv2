A app-based ‘bank’ with a pre-paid debit card with contactless. No fees for spending abroad and no ATM fees. No bank account, so you can’t get paid into here.

The idea is that you only use this card for everything, and manage your money by the app. It’s smart, so can categorize any spending (pub, supermarket etc) and you can set limits (£300 a month on food, for example)

If you are new to London, and just need a card for paying for shit, this could be a good option. It’s free, the card is free, and comes within days.
