### [Frazer’s Razors – The NEW META?](https://fazthebro.com/2021/05/13/frazers-razors-the-new-meta/)

6 months ago I decided to ditch the ol’ Gillette Mach III and get the cheapest razor I could buy – the BIC 20 pack. Isn’t a razor just a razor? Isn’t stainless steel just stainless steel? Let’s find out.  
  
**Gillette Mach III:**  
– £15 for 8 Blades (handle not included)  
– 3 stainless steel blades  
– £1.8 per blade

**BIC:**  
– £4 for a 20 pack (handles included on each)  
– 3 stainless steel blades  
– 20p per blade  
  
**Harrys (seems popular):**  
– £8 for 4 blades (handle not included)  
– 5 stainless steel blades  
– £2 per blade

So on the face of it, we can see the BIC has the same specs as the Gillette, for a hell of a lot cheaper. The Harrys has 5 blades – but do you really need that many? Theoretically the fewer blades you have the better the shave. There is a reason why professional groomers use a cut-throat single blade.

The BIC triple Razor – for sensitive skin

So, onto the part you are all waiting for: the review! Yes, the BIC provides as good of a shave as any shaver I have used. I have done good time on Gillette fusion 5 blade, the Mach 3, the Mach 2, and the Shick Quattro, so I’ve been around the block. The BIC is as good as any of these for closeness and sharpness. I also found that the razors last just as long as any named brand. A blade is a blade.

However there is one BIG caveat. For my shaving frequency, the shave takes forever. I shave maybe once every 10 days, so the hairs get long. And my electric shaver doesn’t work so I can’t trim before it. The blades seem to be closer together or something on the BICs and hairs get trapped in, which means you are always having to tap it and remove hairs. However, if you shave every day or second day, this issue doesn’t occur. The moisturizing pad on the shavers are actually pretty decent too!

_So, **the verdict:**_

Yes, the BIC blades are as good as any other, but they are especially good for people who shave frequently. I am going to continue using them, as they are so much cheaper. Somehow the blade companies have brainwashed all us suckers into paying 10x their value – just like Weber Q gas canisters…but we will save that for a future post!

### [FTBs MIQ | Day 1-4 | ‘Settling in’](https://fazthebro.com/2021/03/17/ftbs-miq-day-1-4-settling-in/)

Hi everyone, and welcome back to the hit series: _FTBs MIQ!_

Surprisingly, stuck in a room for the whole day doesn’t give you as much free time as you like. I haven’t found time to write the blog, so I’m packing in a couple days here as they are all basically the same. With a gaming laptop and a good internet connection and 0 guilt about playing games…well.

**Day 1**

We have been set into a small ‘group’ who gets our Covid tests done together. Got a covid test. The meals aren’t terrible, just bang average.

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/meal-edited.jpg)

Americas Cup is on, and all everyone is talking about. Tune in on the 4K TV – not bad reception. The ‘expert’ panel cracks me up. Everyone but Dean Barker doesn’t look like they’ve been on a boat before in their life – except for the dude who may have arrived on one.

**Day 2**

We have gotten a blue band and are allowed out! There is a walking track that you can book. It is a 4:35 round trip walking. 40 mins I did a bit over 5k steps.

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/walkingtrack-1920x1080.jpg)

So far have basically just played a ton of Warzone! The aussie servers aren’t great, a lot of problems with ping and crashes and packet loss – a mate commented he had a bit of packet loss in London as well 😛

The death comms are the best thing about Aussie servers. I don’t think I’ve been called a faggot more in my life outside a session with Pmac and Camby.

**Day 3**

On my daily walk. A cougar is walking the track. Mid forties, blonde, probably does a good amount of yoga. After a couple laps she has made friends with a big young Fijian dude walking the track in Jandals. They now walking together which I’m not sure is allowed. Wonder what will happen there!

**Day 4**

WARZONE WIN! Finally we won a bloody game of Warzone. Rusty, my ‘friend’ from the MIQ page who also is in isolation have been playing about 7 hours a day. The lack of wins was getting a bit rediculous. When the doctor here calls me for the ‘daily mental health check’ during a game I just want to say ‘ I play a game for 7 hours a day and I’m still shit. How do you think I’m fuckin feeling?’

Fucked up a deployment at work. Made a change without telling anyone and probably in trouble. Probably shouldn’t do prod deployments while 1. Jetlagged 2. Boozed and 3. Playing Warzone at the same time…

Game of CS with the kiwi boys! We won one and lost one. I played terrible. But Sloan and the boys keep the spirits high.

**Day 5**

NZ wins Americas Cup. Well done. The commentary is so biased it almost seems self aware. When NZ in front: ‘Emirates Team New Zealand are playing it brilliantly, excellent move there, the lead is mounting’  
When Italy regains the lead: ‘Looks like the race is in nature’s hands at the moment’

**Tech Specs:**

Warzone Games: 70 (fuck me)  
Warzone Wins: 2  
Good Meal ratio: 4/16  
Tugs: 11

### [New Series: FTB in MIQ!](https://fazthebro.com/2021/03/12/new-series-ftb-in-miq/)

Good morning dear readers, and welcome to an exciting new project from the team here at fazthebro.com.

As I am writing this, I am beginning day 2 of a 14 day period spent in managed isolation in New Zealand. This new blog series will examine the intricacies of managed isolation on the mind and body, have multiple reviews of my day, and of course – a ton of IT security content!

I will begin the first entry in this post. So sit back, relax, and enjoy from your own lockdown/freedom, wherever you may be.

FTBs MIQ | Day 1 | “Arrival”
----------------------------

A cold, dreary day. FTB was making his way to Arsenal station, backpack and suitcase in tow. The wheels of the suitcase groaned on the cobble footpath, the bearings filling up with water and grit from the rain. Perhaps the Samsonite would have been a better choice – the ratings on the Chinese suitcase bearings weren’t anywhere near ABEC standards – and even once you get into Arsenal station there is still a fair walk ahead of you. Gritting his teeth, he hoped his final destination would provide better fortunes with the weather.

The Piccadilly line was running a good service to Heathrow, not that FTB was surprised. After the Blue Bullet, this was his favourite line, closely followed by the Bakerloo. Watching the rackety train approach, what looked like a 00’s refresh car, he smiled to himself. The stations on the Piccadilly are some of the most beautiful in London, not that many of the new generation would notice from beyond their phones.

The car arrived at Terminal 2 with 80 minutes till take-off. Some people would think this is cutting it fine – he knew otherwise. How many times have you ever been close to missing a flight? The closest FTB ever came to missing a flight was in Bangkok, with a friend of his. In this occasion, the plan was to fly into Bangkok, take a taxi to the other Bangkok airport, then fly out to Vietnam. On arrival to the second airport, they realised the airport they actually were flying to Vietnam in was the one they had just left! An hour late to the flight, they still made it on.

Heathrow was eerie. Police and army were the only faces to be seen behind masks. This wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, as FTB went straight through all checks without delay. He thought how nice it was to travel without being held up by mongs.

He boarded the flight without incident, without speaking to anyone outside the usual twenty ‘Thank-yous’ spoken during boarding. The plane was the new Airbus A350. FTB was lucky enough to see one being built at the Airbus factory in Toulouse. One of his favourite planes, and his first time on it, was a special moment. He marvelled at the beauty of it and touched the fuselage on the way in.

Settling into his Business-class seat (FTB makes a shitload out of computers, not to mention his blog, after all) he made his drink order for a Tiger beer and got comfortable. Searching for something to watch was as tedious as it was at home. 2020 had been a shit year for a multitude of reasons, not least of which was the lack of new media. He settled on Detective Pikachu (not that bad, Bulbasaur looked awesome and Gengar ‘meh’ but quite fun) and fell asleep for the next 8 hours.

Once in Singapore, he wasn’t allowed to leave his seat before taking off again. As he took in the sweet smell of Kerosene during refueling, he thought: don’t we normally disembark to refuel safely? Guess it’s not a risk anymore. Back in the air 90 minutes later, he didn’t feel like sleeping. The smooth ride on the 87km/h tailwind combined with the turbulence prediction system on the 350 makes it easy to nod off but he felt like watching something.

Anthony Bourdain in Lagos was a great watch. He planned to recommend it to his readers.

Upon arrival in Auckland it was as he hoped – a warm blue sky day. Whisked straight from the plane into a bus, he thought again to himself how eerie the terminal was. No other flights except for his one. His MIQ destination: Holiday Inn Auckland Airport.

The Inn was 10 minutes bus ride from the Airport. One by one they disembarked the bus, checked in, had a room assigned. His room was actually pretty great. A balcony in the sun overlooking a water feature. Big double bed. Decent 4K Sony TV. He thought he could spend the time fairly easily as long as the internet was good. 80 gig down with an Ethernet cable. FTB lifted his eyebrows in surprise. Not bad.

The first meals were all vegetarian and you couldn’t choose them. For lunch was a dry bagel with what looked like chicken and brie, with a horrific potato salad on the side. Not a great start. He decided to order some beers. Steinlager pure or Corona for $5 a bottle. He heard you can’t take in your own piss anymore, as this rule always ends in disaster for Kiwis, even if they are alone it seems. When he left New Zealand almost 6 years earlier he remembered that Steinlager pure was considered to be a good beer. He left the thought at that. He closed his eyes and imagined the bright blues and reds of the Fosters can while drinking it in.

He fired up the laptop, did some admin, then played a couple games of Warzone. He got rekt multiple times then gave it up as a bad job. Another beer in the sun. Dinner arrived and was even more dog shit than the lunch – it actually looked like a dog shat on some noodles. At least the taste was so bland not to be horrible.

He conceded to bedtime at 9:30pm. He was surprised he made it so far – he woke from his last sleep 24 hours earlier Our hero settled into a dreamless sleep.

#### Tech Specs:

Plane speed: 1020km/h with tailwind  
Room download speed: 80mb/s on Ethernet  
Room TV: Sony 4K  
Outside Temperature: 24 Degrees Celcius  
Beer temp: ~6 Degrees approx

Hi readers,

Exciting news for all!

Tonight is the fazthebro.com Annual General Meeting, where we discuss the year in retrospect, plans for the future, and the IT security sector in general. I think we can all say it has been a hell of a year for bad or for worse, but the blog has kept running and helping spirits in these tough times.

The AGM will be held in a Fullers pub, as they have been considering sponsorship of the blog ever since the Michael Ash post (more on this later!) – definitely has nothing to do with the free pint offer today.

**In attendance:**

**J Taylor** – Chairman of the board (to provide the minutes shortly)

**F Davidson –** Founder, CEO and IT helpdesk support

**R Mccoy** (Zoom) – Financial Controller and Blog Contributor

**H Boyd** – Sales Director and Home Security Specialist

**D Brewer** – Risk & Portfolio manager and Foreign Liaison (Albanian Division)

### [Art is in the eye of the beer-holder](https://fazthebro.com/2020/09/17/art-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beer-holder/)

Hi everyone, long time no post (as usual)

Today we have a rather unusual post for the blog. No mentions of IT security whatsoever. You may stop reading here if you just want securitips!

Today we are talking about art. Art is everywhere you look. In the galleries. In sports. In your cable management. Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time. It evokes our emotions, moves us, and takes a snapshot of history forever more.

Sometimes, an artist comes along who doesn’t just move people, but creates a movement. He inspires and educates. He changes the world.

This artist I am talking about is of course:  _John Gilroy._

Born in Whitley bay, John  casually started out life as a war hero in WW1. Like all artists, he started out as an amateur, not much recognition. But then he got a job in advertising, and took the world by storm.

John Gilroy is the man behind ‘My Goodness, my Guinness’, ‘Guinness is good for you’ and every other Guinness ad from 1928 – 1960.

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8692/16644026317_85c1b29039_o.jpg)

Artist and poet.

![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3f/f3/4e/3ff34e9ec571a3b53565b1ab9b820956.jpg)

Bet you feel like a Guinness right about now?

So please dear readers, next time you pick up that delicious creamy pint of the black stuff, take a moment to appreciate the artists – who carried Guinness through time, found the perfect mix of ingredients, designed the keg and piping system. Hell take a moment to thank Michael Ash for the nitrogen he added to it. You owe them.

### [Guest Post: Rudgey!](https://fazthebro.com/2020/05/01/guest-post-rudgey/)

A quick preface to this one – after Ollie’s letter to the editor, I had some fast, furious and fantastic feedback. This one is a guest post from Rudgey, a great friend and colleague of mine who really loves the blog. He wanted to talk about a fairly controversial subject that he has a lot of expertise in, and well…I think I’ll just leave it to him! Enjoy.

**Rudge:**
==========

This topic is surely one that will divide all of you IT Security fanatics out there. This is one that has subconsciously caused more discussion than GDPR & Brexit combined in 2018 at your average wanker banker pub in the City of London.

You guessed it…..the topic is “The Perfect Pint!”

THE LIES
--------

How often have you heard the sayings from all of those that like to partake in codology out there:

1.  _“Beer is so much more that just a drink. It is about the overall experience – good taste, ideally suited food pairing, served in proper pubs by landlords who are obsessed with beer quality and do things the right way when it comes to conditioning” – average upper-middle/upper class respondent_
2.  _“Guinness doesn’t travel well” – enraged Dublin citizen in Budapest_
3.  _“The landlord hasn’t cleaned the pipes this month” – Kensington Digital Marketer_
4.  _“I’m passionate about doing things properly” – silver spoon fed child_
5.  _“This Sauvignon Blanc is awful, I’d far rather a Jules Taylor” – stereotypical New Zealand female trying to keep up with the Joneses (yes this blog post can also warmly relate to “The Perfect Wine Glass” – there are many parallels)_

Following that, how about those surveys!

_“More worryingly for the industry, 23% of respondents said they rarely drink a faultless pint, with 32% complaining that the serving temperature is always incorrect and 38% stating that the experience is often spoilt by dirty glassware.”_

Using our beloved IT terminology, we like to call these people **“spoofers”.** They are using our IPs and we need better firewalls to protect ourselves from these unwanted threats.

You see, the funny thing is, the respondents above are statistically speaking likely to **_fail_** the blindfold test. Blind fold your everyday Anglo-Saxon, put multiple options of beer/wine in front of them, and get them to tell the difference between both the _type_ and the _quality_ of drink and there is an incredibly large chance that they will fail this with flying colours.

Now trust me I went through a period of saying these things, albeit a short one, so yes I was once one of these people, however with some retrospective reflection I realised not only what was important for me, but also important for the majority readers out there (I hope).

Now, lets embark on our journey to go _phishing_ for the truth of the “Perfect Pint”…

The Truth
---------

The truth has never been more simple, it is never about the taste, the temperature or the quality (although you will see it plays an immaterial part as per below). It is about every variable being as good is it can possibly be. Similar to life, every moment of the day there are constant variables consisting of tiny parts, that add up to the large sum called life. Our large sum is called “The Perfect Pint”.

I am about to unveil all of these tiny parts and you as an everlasting loyal [fazthebro.com](http://fazthebro.com/) reader, can put them together to see the sum. The key point here is that _everyone has slightly different variables_. Here are a few things I have learnt over the years that makes the perfect pint for me.

*   Season: Late Autumn
*   Weather: 8-12 degrees, clear blue sky
*   Temperature (outside/inside): In Autumn you tend hunker down a little after a big summer and the temperature is now at a point where you are considering a jersey. The satisfaction of wrappy up and getting that first “cozy” feeling is amazing (like when you are under a blanket watching a rom com). It also means you are not sweaty, not too cold, and just at the right level.
*   Time of day: 3pm. You’ve had a good sleep in and cuddle with your beloved girlfriend/boyfriend, gone out for a delicious salmon and eggs on toast, and have got in a nice bit of exercise with your mate Greg. You are now ready for a pint, Congratulations!
*   The type of week you’ve had: You’ve had a productive week at work, hit your deliverables, been exercising, eating healthily and you have not seen your friends for a while so this really excites you
*   Company size: This is an interesting one. For me 4-5 people is good for the initial stages. Not too crowded, not too personal, but still a good level of intimacy and camaraderie.
*   Drink number: Ideally the best satisfaction comes from the 1-2 pints. When you are not as tipsy and have all senses to saviour all of the variables and analyse them
*   Food: N/A. This is a common myth. Provided you’ve had a substantial brunch/lunch and will eat later, _food is irrelevant and a distraction_
*   Pub: You’re in a nice _slightly gentrified_, but traditional cosy pub, ideally with a carpet floor and a fireplace and lights not blinding.
*   Ambience: the pub is busy but still a few spare tables and everyone is civilised but lively and full of joy. Can hold a conversation at a normal home level
*   Music: easy going, nothing too pop/modern. Ideally 90s, early 2000s sing alongs that are well known, but not often played
*   Mobile phone: in the ideal world, we would put these on airplane mode upon walking in the door, but that’s _just not what we do._ So best when there are no messages received and the focus is on your comrades. Phones are normally visible due to the fact that you are trying to get the other folks down to the pub.
*   Gulps: generally 12-15 gulps to the pint (maybe 20mins to finish?). I’d have to get back to you on this one, it is something not often measured.
*   Presentation: As long as it is filled right up, this doesn’t matter. Even if it is splilling over and messy, adds to the character!

Any finally, drumroll please…….

Beer: I do like this slightly chilled but not too cold, such as Guinness for its temperature and smoothness. But as this post reiterates, this is an immaterial decision because when you combine the variables above, _any beer tastes so damn good._

### [Letters to the editor: A real one!](https://fazthebro.com/2020/05/01/letters-to-the-editor-a-real-one/)

Hi everyone, today I have a letter sent in by one of our most avid young readers, Cameron Olliver! I’ll post it below, but first can I please say thanks Cameron for all the support over the years. You have kept the comment section really busy and we couldn’t have done all the technical and emotional support at ftb.com without you!

Camerons letter:

> A fella named Jackie once said; “A life is not important, except in the impact it has on other lives”. That could be bullshit, but it rings true for a blog. And this blog, comparable to Jackie being the first black man to play baseball in the major leagues, is the first IT security blog to hit the big time. Just like Jackie gave it to the Yankees in 1955, FTB security is giving it to the knobs of Silicon Valley.
> 
> If that didn’t act like a blue pill for your purple headed yogurt slinger, then hopefully some points on how Fazthebro and FTB IT Security changed my life;
> 
> *   (May 21, 2017)
> *   Apps on apps. Helped me change the way I used the cell.
> *   (June 12, 2017) I traded cereal for eggs and avocado on toast! This is a hell of an IT security ploy. Feed the brain, become more alert, don’t click on dumb shit that will give you a virus.
> *   (July 5, 2017) Got a fidget spinner.
> *   (August 22, 2017) I learnt how to get a big compo payout. Who knew it was good to fly with a shit airline.
> *   (September 21, 2017) I learnt to vote in NZ. Waste of time though with the lefty pricks getting in without the popular vote.
> 
> Thanks to Fazthebro for being that solid voice amongst the crap that the internet dishes up. Please keep enlightening us all. May you go down as the Jackie Robinson of the IT security world – the first Slav to the top.

…I’m not crying, you’re crying.

### [Genius lockdown idea!](https://fazthebro.com/2020/04/30/genius-lockdown-idea/)

Hi all, today I have a really special treat for you, that will make you go ‘why didn’t I think of that??’

It’s a tip for this lockdown we all find ourselves in, and could have huge financial upsides with very little downside risk:

_Commit some crimes._

That’s right – as long as you keep the crimes minor or white-collar enough, you will only be sentenced to house arrest, which you are fucking doing already! It’s basically risk free!

Examples of some house arrest crimes:

> Examples include driving while intoxicated and many white-collar crimes, such as fraud or embezzlement.

Go out and drive! Scam some of the working class! …pmac!

Thanks for tuning in to this great tip.

_Edit: My editor requested I removed one of the crime ideas._

### [Cooking tips for lockdown](https://fazthebro.com/2020/04/25/cooking-tips-for-lockdown/)

Get a honing stick for your knives. You should be honing them every week to keep them nice and sharp, and sharpen them about every 6-12 months. It really makes a difference, especially if you use a plastic cutting board.

Also get a meat thermometer. You will wonder how you ever lived without. 55-60 degrees for a perfect medium rare!

### [Looks like the recession is cancelled after all…](https://fazthebro.com/2020/04/16/looks-like-the-recession-is-cancelled-after-all/)

Today on my daily exercise I noticed that all of the cafes are open in Highbury, selling takeaway coffee and croissants.

I saw big lines of people, all standing two meters apart, waiting to get their fix.

Not only are people still paying over 3 quid for a coffee, but they are fucking _queuing_ for 30 minutes to get it.

Why can’t they open pubs for takeaway Guinness?? FFS I can make a coffee at home. The Guinness cans just aren’t in the same universe, let alone the same level as one from the keg.

Thanks for tuning in to this weeks security tips!

### [Stansted Airport Tip](https://fazthebro.com/2020/03/09/stansted-airport-tip/)

Finally got to measure my hunch last night at Stansted Airport. When lining up for E-Passport gates, always take the LEFT hand lane.

The left line has almost twice as many machines as the right hand line, and the line is actually shorter. I measured this by tracking a guy next to me who took the right hand line – I would estimate him to be at least 10 minutes behind me as I went through.

Also, if it says ‘seek assistance’ just exit, re-enter and try again. And then try a different line if it doesn’t work. Just like computing, turning it off and on again works!

### [Letters to the Editor: Podcasts](https://fazthebro.com/2020/02/27/letters-to-the-editor-podcasts/)

This week we have a letter from G. Bod, his question:

_FTB, thanks so much for this blog, it is incredibly well written, sometimes moving, and has saved me from the internet bad guys countless times. Anyway my question – I really love broadening my horizons and learning about things other than accounting. What are some interesting podcasts you like that I can listen to?_

I know what you are thinking dear readers: this is the guy who thought that South America speaks Spanish by coincidence – and who puts frozen chicken in the rice cooker – surely this question is made up. Well I think it’s great you want to broaden those horizons G!

This is a quick overview over a range of topics that I enjoyed and think are important. I am including youtube links but only including ones that are on Apple/Spotify/Podcast Addict too (use this app you mongs)

### 1\. Peter Thiel x Eric Weinstein

This would be my must listen podcast. Thiel and Weinstein are extremely intelligent and know a range of issues, mainly to do with growth of industry, science and economy. They go over topics like ‘has the economy actually grown since the 70s?’ ‘What technological progress has happened outside the world of bits?’ ‘Why is physics/quantum physics study not bringing any real-world applications?’ ‘Where are the self driving cars and cancer cures?’

They also discuss what university has become and how shit it is. Might do an expose on that topic.

It’s really good.

### 2\. Joe Rogan x Brian Cox

If you like astronomy and space, this podcast is a great taster. Rogan is pretty dumb, so keeps the conversation light and interesting. They go over topics like black holes, gravity, aliens, recent discoveries in astronomy and physics. Brian Cox is a great entertainer and really engaging for being a bit of a beta.

### 3\. Joe Rogan x Ceara Lynch

This girl shits in bags and sells them to guys on the internet. Enough said.

I’ve got plenty more where these came from, especially in the science and astronomy areas. Let us know if you want more in the comments G!

Podcasts to avoid:

*   Freakonomics radio
*   Philosophize this!

Hope this answered your question G!

Cheers, FTB

### [I’ve made a mistake.](https://fazthebro.com/2020/02/27/ive-made-a-mistake/)

Google cloud is fucking expensive!

The month of January cost £48 for this blog! Can you believe that? I know hard-hitting journalism isn’t free, but cmon Google you are trying to get in the cloud game – look out for the little guy!

A load balancer with one forwarding rule is £14 minimum. Just to sit there. Per month. Before tax. This is free in Azure.

The (1 core, 3.5gb ram) Server was over £20! Fucking criminal!

Needless to say, I have moved port to a free Azure subscription, we are back in Kubernetes, with a (2 core 4gb ram) VM, the whole exact same solution costing…

£15 per month. Which I plan to reduce with some trickery.

Lets not even talk about AWS…just to have the ‘right’ to have a Kubernetes cluster costs £160 per month…without any compute.

It really speaks to how good the team at FTB is that we can replatform the whole site to a new cloud in under 20 minutes without any DR planning – or even an Azure subscription.

Moral of the story is: Azure going to win the cloud wars!

### [Photo Sharing. Why is it so hard?](https://fazthebro.com/2020/02/18/photo-sharing-why-is-it-so-hard/)

We’ve all been through it – Bae: _“Send me the photos from yesterday. Rapido, adelente, ahora!”_

You open up Whatsapp, select every photo and it’s 4 identical copies, and send multiple 12mb images that are somehow now 10kb.

Why are they so compressed? Because Whatsapp likes to save bandwidth and compresses the shit out of your images and videos. That’s why they always look pretty average on the other end, and can’t be printed out. Take this one shot of the blog on an iPhone 11 for example:

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/download1.png)

Why??

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/download.png)

Oh wait, that was actually before it was compressed. haha. iPhone. Amirite?

_So FTB, how should I be sending photos in good quality? iPhone and Android don’t really mix with device sharing…_

If you aren’t using it already, and are happy to sell your soul to Google, download _Google Photos._ It is fantastic, and certified mint by FTB. They offer unlimited backups for free of photos, all tied into your gmail account, and it is available on IOS and Android!

The photos are compressed with Googles algo – which is surprisingly indistinguishable from original quality – kind of has to be seen to be believed…

Once your photos are in the app, you can share them via a cloud album, or just start a ‘chat’ with someone else and add them in there, just like Whatsapp.

### [Promise and Deliver](https://fazthebro.com/2020/02/14/promise-and-deliver/)

Hi everyone, and welcome back to the FTB.com motivational series: _Putting the ‘B’ into FTB – motivation and me!_

Today we are going to look at the age old proverb: That you should always under promise, and over deliver.

In other words, you should exceed the customers expectations. Do what you know you can do. Keep everyone happy. This is shit advice!

_But FTB, we were always told this since we were very young…?_

In the real world, or the IT world – especially in big corporations – almost the opposite is true. It is advantageous to over promise – and people who do, tend to get to the top quicker. Why is that you ask?

Contracts. In a business, you are always competing for a contract of some sort (new project at work, being noticed in the team, a sale to a customer) and the guy who promises the most bang for buck wins. Plain and simple. If you over promise over your peers, you win the contract – and you have to be in to win. Now you would say that over promising can be dangerous – as the customer may never come back if you under deliver – and you would be right. But this generally tends to not be the case, as people understand that delays are a thing, problems come up.

Let’s take an example – in your car you’ve blown a tranny (not literally @Trandy!) and you take it to two mechanics for a quote. Both mechanics don’t know how to fix transmissions – and Mr Nice Guy “Mechanic A” says the truth, it might take a while. “Mechanic B” (our avid FTB.com readers) would say: “Fuck yes I know how to fix trannys. My mates one.”

In the end, Mechanic B gets the money, gets the car, and now needs to learn how to fix transmissions fuckin fast. And under pressure, people tend to perform. He gets the money, and gets the job done even though he didn’t know he could do it. Even if he couldn’t do it in time, too bad, I have the car and it may take a couple days longer.

Over delivering is pointless, bosses don’t appreciate it. They will just give you more work to do and won’t let you leave early.

This is nice, but what you really want to do is over promise _and_ over deliver.

True greatness in history always comes from a person over promising. You don’t create something amazing by doing what you know. When IBM asked Bill Gates if DOS would be ready in the next week in the 90’s, he said ‘Yes it’s basically done’ – even though he hadn’t written a single line of code (true story).

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/iq6OAVD0ocBFu/giphy.gif)

Bill Gates said he’d be able to jump this chair – he never had jumped before

I promise you guys amazing, well thought out IT journalism and by god I keep just going that extra mile. That’s why this blog is as big as it is.

Remember, life is easier the lower you keep everyone’s expectations. Until the next one!

### [Guess who’s back](https://fazthebro.com/2019/12/10/guess-whos-back/)

Hello followers!

New year, new company, new platform. The blog is back online after over a year!

Why offline for so long you ask? Well, AWS gives a free tier of servers for a year. After a year and a bit, I started realizing that keeping a blog running without ads isn’t free, and had to pull the pin. I want to give the best experience for all of you, so instead of putting ads on the blog I just decided to shut down in protest.

So why am I back? Good news, Google Cloud Platform offers £200 in free hosting, so I’m gonna be back for a while! And once again, our tech stack is completely different!

Dear readers, our journey has taken us from our humble beginnings – a single Amazon server, 1gb ram, 0.5 cores with NGINX installed – to a 2gb ram / 1 core Docker host – we are now at the pinnacle of blog power…

Master forgive me…but we now have…

TWO 8gb ram / 2 core hosts running KUBERNETES behind Cloudflare!

We have auto deployment, helm registry, istio, Lets encrypt with ACME – jesus this tech stack is a recruiters wet dream.

For all the noobs out there, this basically means the blog should go down less than it used to (that was about every day)

In other news, I had a letter recently from David Hills asking why the blog now sends updates to his spam box in his email. Good question David!

See you in the next one.

### [FTB Rants: RyanAir](https://fazthebro.com/2018/04/03/ftb-rants-ryanair/)

Whether you love ’em or hate ’em, chances are, you aren’t a part of the ‘95% of flights are on time!’

Welcome back to another edition of FTB rants, where we talk all things security, IT, and everything in between. Today’s victim, the future #1 most hated company in Europe, RyanAir.

There are many reasons to dislike RyanAir, the largest (and saddest) is the destruction of Europe’s best destinations with tourists. Flights can be so cheap now, the ‘RyanAir effect’ has every weekend of the year flooding beautiful places like Prague, Venice, Barcelona with mongs and lager-louts – where it used to be reserved for nice, cultured, unassuming, well dressed rich people!

The main problem I want to discuss today however, is the seating algorithm. over 6 Months ago, I posted about why I hate RyanAir, because the seating algorithm seemed to have changed. You used to get put together if you were on the same booking, but overnight it seemed randomly allocated. RyanAir was called out at the time, to which they responded:

> We have not changed our seating algorithm at all. It is random, as it always has been.

Bullshit.

I recently went to Portugal with bae, and paid £220 for my flight. So cheap, I know. When going to check in, the site said:  
‘warning, you are not sitting together! Upgrade for £8.’  
I’m not the kind of guy to have 8 bucks lying around, so voila, we were sitting apart. Me in row 31, her in row 4.

The lady next to me asked if I could switch with her husband, who was in the row in front. She was in the middle, and so was he, so I didn’t want to give up my aisle seat. Now here’s the kicker – the seat next to her was _empty._ The husband just got up and moved. Also, the seat next to bae was empty. And the son of this couple was the seat over from that, next to bae!

After take-off, everyone is getting up and moving seats due to this bullshit.

The algorithm basically is this: You will be seated in a middle seat  by default – unless you sitting there means that you get to sit next to your partner (or enable another couple to sit next to each other). It will also try to put you as far from your partner as possible. I saw a woman get allocated a middle seat, when she was the only person in a row.

So how do you win? Just check in as late as possible. Like in the last 10 minutes. You will get the emergency exit row, as they save these for last in case anyone pays for them. You will also get a chance of sitting next to your partner this way. PLUS they reserve space for your bag!

Fuck RyanAir. FTB out.

### [BitHub.com](https://fazthebro.com/2018/03/22/bithub-com/)

One of the biggest questions I get from the public – be it as an IT Security researcher or just good friend:

> FTB, first off, just want to say thanks so much for all the IT security tips and tricks. It’s really changed my life. In fact, I’ve decided to call my new born son Azreev in honour of the ‘Prince Azreev’ article!

Oh wait, that wasn’t the question. That was just an average sample of my fan mail. The main _question_ I receive is:

> FTB, what the hell is bitcoin? Everyone is buying it, so I did too. That means i’m smart right?
> 
> ![](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iWbj.It3CtUk/v2/800x-1.jpg)
> 
> Bit-Groin, amirite?? HAHAHAH-

I could go on all day about Bitcoin. The tech behind it is fascinating, and fucking cool. But something in the blockchain is currently making headlines from our favourite cryptocurrency:

**Child Porn.**

In the huge blockchain of transactions that make up Bitcoins history – you are allowed to add a message (generally a note about the transaction itself) but of course, this has been abused, as everything that gets exposed to the internet does. Researchers have just found thousands of links to child porn images, and have found at least one full image embedded in the blockchain. So if you have a bitcoin wallet – you probably have kiddie porn on your PC!

Sure the price fell, and its impossible to get rid of these links so – death of blockchain as we know it? I’m sure the regulators are ready to pounce on this one…

Tip of the day: If you find something like this in another currency, make sure you sell it and short it _before_ messaging the New York Times!

FTB OUT.

> How many shirts would a clean shirt clean if a clean shirt could clean shirts?

Hi everyone, I’m back! I know it’s been a rather large hiatus. Work has actually been busy – who saw that coming – plus I have so many extra curricular activities I find it hard to make time to update everyone on security.

Anyway, let’s get straight into it – _clean shirt?? Sure, I’m an accountant and I wear one FTB, what gives??_

Clean shirt is a member of staff at my work who always wears crispy clean shirts (suspect his Thai wife has something to do with the quality of the ironing) and is very loud, obnoxious, and annoying. Every day at 8:30 on the dot, he is blasting away about some shit story – if he has exhausted the racist rants about his team that is.

It’s gotten to the point where I don’t want to wear shirts in public anymore, let alone clean ones!

Peep show coined our villians name

I’m sure you all have a ‘clean shirt’ at your work. So the question is, what can I do about it? I’ve tried a few methods, none of which are even having limited success..

*   Talking down to him even though he is in a managerial position
*   Completely ignoring him while he addresses me directly
*   Said ‘have you heard of email cunt?’ when he was yelling his head off to a colleague about different fabric softener brands
*   Worn dirty shirts

Nothing seems to work. The guy thinks he’s super important and is planning the next desk move. Since I am actually important, two guesses where i’ll be sitting…thank god for noise cancelling headphones.

Well watch this space guys…let us know your clean shirt solutions in the comments, and join me in saying…

Right, straight into it – Finsbury Park Station is becoming _even_ _better._

Opening in the next few months are new state-of-the-art Thameslink Trains, connecting from Finsbury to Brighton. This includes stops at KCSP, Blackfriars, AND Gatwick!

The line is using new tunnels in an effort to stop congestion of people doing the Vic – Northern Bank branch route. In just 14 years the amount of people using this route has increased 70%.! 8 Trains an hour will run, and there will even be an app that tells you the status of the train, which carriages have seats available, among many other cool things.

So now Finsbury Park has the bullet, PFC, Rowans, BoF, plus direct trains to Stansted, Gatwick AND Heathrow! Southern Fairys – how about you move back to London?

Aren’t they the best in the world? You might step on one in the dark and it proper knacks, but that’s just another sign that it’s a sturdy plug!

Have you ever been to the continent with those scary 2 prong things that just plug into live sockets and sometimes they crackle? They scare the shit out of me. Most of them don’t even have switches to turn them on and off before you stick your fingers there to pull the plug out.

Power surge? The fuse in the plug blows instead of your TV!

Kid trying to stick things in the plug? No worries, you need something plugged into the earth socket before it opens the slots for the actual live parts of the circuit. How bloody good is that?

Also, do kids in other countries learn the beauty of how to wire a plug and change a fuse?

How good are British plugs?

*   80% of Soviet males born in 1923 didn’t survive WWII.
*   Lake Superior has 10% of all the fresh water _in the world_.
*   Jurassic Park was released closer to the Moon landing than to the present day.
*   It took 4 times longer for man to go from bronze swords to iron swords than iron swords to nuclear weapons.
*   When they first calculated the height of mount everest they decided to add a couple feet because they figured nobody would believe that it was exactly 29,000ft.

> “Peak XV (measured in feet) was calculated to be exactly 29,000 ft (8,839.2 m) high, but was publicly declared to be 29,002 ft (8,839.8 m) in order to avoid the impression that an exact height of 29,000 feet (8,839.2 m) was nothing more than a rounded estimate.”

*   Oxford University is older than the Aztec Empire
*   The U.S. spends more on its military defense budget than the next seven countries combined.

Hopefully a higher effort post next time?

### [WWW? Nah, WW1](https://fazthebro.com/2017/12/20/www-nah-ww1/)

Did you know that within the first 6 months of Britain entering the great war, Germany already had bombers flying over London?

![](https://history.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/01/AIR11-237-Graf-Zeppelin-over-St-Pauls-Cathedral-London-1930.jpg)

German Zeppelin over St Pauls Cathedral

In fact, the first bomb dropped on London was near the River, in Stoke Newington. As the German Kaiser and the British King were cousins, the Kaiser ordered incendiary bombs to be dropped only on the outskirts of London (North London and East, mainly) but there were also a few dropped on South London (Pimlico) and even South England (Clapham)!

These big balls of Hydrogen could carry 6 gunners, 2 being stationed on the top of the balloon, and enough bombs to light up about 5 houses. Once the war became more intense over time, the Kaiser ordered Central London to be bombed also – but try not hit the landmarks!

The Zeppelins were launched from Belgium, and as such, they could be blown away with a small amount of wind. In fact, many were shot down this way, as they couldn’t get home quick enough to outrun the RAF.

### [Genuine? Genuine shit!](https://fazthebro.com/2017/12/01/genuine-genuine-shit/)

Here’s a ball-buster for you:

_‘Genuine’ leather is the second-worst type of leather there is._

That’s right. It’s actually shit leather, treated and cut up to be made to look like a real leather piece.  
This got me thinking – what else is thought of as ‘good’ but actually isn’t? Well NZ’ers, buckle up, you might hear some things that aren’t nice.

_1: Most of the Kiwifruit consumed in NZ is actually imported._

I went back home in February, and immediately jumped in to the food cupboard, wanting some actual taste after 2 years in London. After having what seemed like the best Kiwifruit I’ve ever tasted – turns out it was from Italy. Turns out, continental Europe get all our best Kiwifruit. If you wan’t good NZ goods, move to Spain.

_2: Overseas, NZ meat is considered cheap, and ‘middle to low grade’_

We are brought up thinking we are the tits, but overseas, the cheap cuts of lamb are most often from NZ. After a bit of research, I found that even our top cuts of export lamb are considered ‘middle grade’ meat – most overseas consumers find it too ‘muttony’ or gamey. The same goes for our beef too. In school, being told we are the best in the meat trade is almost like a pledge of allegiance, and this surprised me.

_3: Almost every single underground line is ripping you off for the price._

Two years of study by the scientists at ftb.com have made an astounding discovery – aside from only ONE line, the underground is ripping you off more than a Romanian shell game on Westminster Bridge.  
How you ask?  
_All underground lines cost the same._ For the same price as the Victoria Line (which is perfectly in equilibrium pricing) the other lines have the nerve to charge the same for their shit service. No wonder the Northern Line has the most suicides – by far.

### [The Beauty of Computers](https://fazthebro.com/2017/11/21/the-beauty-of-computers/)

While surfing the web, I often come across interesting quotes by great men, philosophers, economists. One that particularly stood out to me today was this:

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/09495e8.jpg)

Also:

_“Continuous effort – not strength or intelligence – is the key to unlocking our potential.”_

It made me think: this is the true beauty and power of computers. While humans are smart\*, we get frustrated and tired and sick of doing things over and over. Computers will try and fail at a task billions of times, only to re-take it up another billion times with the same enthusiasm.  They can even learn and change their approach along the way.

I think the moral of this story is: how long until I am coded out of my job? Not long I think.

_Edit:_ _The response to this piece has been truly wonderful and I have received some great letters. Reading up on Churchill has really intrigued me to learn more about him, I may write an expose on him next! 🙂_

### [Mathematician of the Week: Michael Ash](https://fazthebro.com/2017/10/20/mathematician-of-the-week-michael-ash/)

Welcome back everyone! Today I have a special treat for you – Math-Man of the Week.

_But FTB, we want mongs, not mathematicians!_

Don’t worry, Mong of the week is still going to happen! Anyway, I’m sure you will enjoy this new section as this is very interesting – Michael Ash is arguably one of the most important humans, and certainly the most important mathematician – to have ever lived.

After four years of dedicating his life to his invention, losing his wife, house and life along the way, he finally made it work, and changed the world forever.

1959 began just like any other year.  Alaska became a US state, Fidel Castro arrived in Havana and the Soviets recognized his government.  The first photos of the far side of the moon were taken. None of these will leave a mark in history like Mike’s invention however.

For in 1959, after 258 years of the same recipe, Mike invented a mechanism that could put _Nitrogen_ into Guinness kegs (instead of the usual CO2). This made the Guinness creamy and smooth like you know it today. Nitrogen bubbles are much smaller than CO2, which allows very high pressure on the beer without making it fizzy. This is why you hear the iconic _hiss_ when a Guinness is poured. The nitrogen is also what gives a Guinness its creamy head, and causes the effect of the ‘cream’ settling in the glass.

If you wanted to try Guinness as it was in the original recipe, Foreign Extra Stout is the closest you can get. I’m sure it is just as delicious – though I’ve never had one!

I think you can all join me in saying:

_‘Thank you Mike – thanks to you,  
creamy Guinness is my go-to,  
I’ve never tasted as fine ‘a brew,  
Because you ditched the CO2.__‘_

Yum….

Some Guinness facts:

*   Although Guinness may appear to be black, it is officially a very dark shade of ruby.
*   Studies claim that Guinness can be beneficial to the heart. Researchers found that “‘antioxidant compounds’ in the Guinness, similar to those found in certain fruits and vegetables, are responsible for the health benefits because they slow down the deposit of harmful cholesterol on the artery walls.
*   Arthur Guinness started brewing ales in 1759 at the St. James’s Gate Brewery, Dublin. On 31 December 1759, he signed a 9,000 year lease at £45 per annum for the unused brewery.
*   “Stout” originally referred to a beer’s strength, but eventually shifted meaning toward body and colour.
*   Originally, Guinness was poured in two stages because it would froth up so much on the first pour, the barman would have to let it settle. This is no longer necessary with the nitrogen Guinness, but the company thought it would ease people into the new recipe if they kept the ritual.

Why do we still have our shitty flag? Oh, because you didn’t vote.

Voting time guys, it’s pretty easy to do from the UK, and if we are going to get Winnie into power we have to vote.

1.  Download your documents [here](https://enrol.elections.org.nz/app/dvp/#/). They are personalised, you have to enter your name address and DOB, so I can’t have a direct DL for you.
2.  Print out the bastards, fill em in, get a witness (doesn’t have to be from NZ) to sign it as well.
3.  (Optional) Tick the boxes for Winston and NZ First.

Now, you have to scan them and upload them to the site. Don’t have a scanner? Neither do I. As my readers will know, there is an app for this, called _Office Lens_ that can ‘scan’ documents using your smartphone.

1.  Scan all the pages using Office Lens.
2.  Move them to Google drive/Dropbox/FTBox

Today is one of our long-time readers birthday! I’m sure everyone will join me in wishing Ollie a great day, and let’s hope he can tear himself away from the blog for a celebration or two 🙂

Cheers for the support Ollie!

### [Letters to the Editor: Sports Streaming](https://fazthebro.com/2017/09/13/letters-to-the-editor-sports-streaming/)

> Hey FTB,
> 
> Thanks for coming back to the blog after that hiatus. Must have been a really busy time for you! I had one question, and I’m sure you have answered it before, how do I stream sports for free?
> 
> Thanks,

> Fill Erup

Hey Fill,

It’s good to be back, and thanks for following the blog. You know, this question is one I get asked almost weekly by my friends! (They don’t know how to use Google) Plus they know I’m a super techhead and security conscious so assume I know about these things. Well, turns out, they are right.

**Tools to Stream**

AceStream – I have already done a write-up on AceStream, which is an Android/PC app for streaming sports. Always in HD and no ads or anything. Check it out [here.](https://fazthebro.com/2017/05/31/want-an-ace-sports-stream-try-ace-stream/)

ChromeCast – if you are serious about streaming things, ChromeCast is awesome. Can easily stream AceStream, Popcorntime, Netflix etc straight to your TV. Only £30, a real bargain.

**Football**

![](https://i.imgur.com/PIJTvO7.gif)

“Ozil is so lazy”

Probably the easiest to stream. http://soccerstreams.online is managed by Reddit users – check this first for links.

Otherwise look at [https://reddit.com/r/soccerstreams](https://reddit.com/r/soccerstreams), click the game you want, and find either direct links or the AceStream ID to use. They usually tell you how many ads, whether to use adblocker, etc.

**Code**

Personally, I think ‘Code’ is the gayest try-hard name for Rugby under the sun – which is why I now use it. Like ‘bae’.  
Almost the same method as football – except there isn’t really a safe site that I know of. Stick to Reddit for threads about streams. [https://reddit.com/r/rugbyunion](https://reddit.com/r/rugbyunion) is your friend here.

**Other Sports**

I think you will see a pattern here. Check Reddit for the sport of choice. They will link it for you, then you can cast it to the TV. (This said, I know most people don’t care about ‘viewing experience’ – and are probably happy to have 10 guys huddled around a phone screen watching Rugby in 140p so they can avoid paying for a ChromeCast.)

As long as you have a good internet connection, streaming sports and TV/Movies is actually really easy now. I don’t know why you would pay for Sky, except for being lazy. Spend the extra money on a gigabit internet connection (Only £48 a month now I believe) jesus.

FTB Out.

Great nick 50 years on

If you had to say one thing that would rise passions from the boys – it would have to be the Victoria Line. The Victoria Line is what separates the ‘_God I hate the tube’_ commuters and the _‘God I love the Bullet. Thank you Viccy. Godspeed.’_ commuters.

Constructed in the 1960s, it was the first entirely new Underground line in London for 50 years, and is one of two entirely ‘Underground’ lines (the other being W&C).  It is used by 200 million passengers each year, making it the sixth-most heavily used line on the network in absolute figures, but in terms of the average number of journeys per mile it is by far the most intensively used line. With good reason!  
It has always been driverless – although a driver sits there. Every day. Getting paid £50k to tell people ‘away from the doors please’.

Now, it is one of the most iconic and beloved attractions in London. I take it every day, and to be honest, the only times I am late to work are on tube strike days. It’s reliable, fast, and friendly – go say gidday to the friendly staff at any station 🙂

**Fun facts:**

When the Circle Line opened in 1884, the experience of riding it was described in The Times as “a form of mild torture”.

The original trains had three different classes, costing three, four and six pence for a single journey.  l A single cash journey in Zone 1 now costs £4.50.

Three babies have been born in the London Underground. The most recent was a boy, born in December 2008.

### [NEW RIG!](https://fazthebro.com/2017/09/06/coming-soon/)

Welcome to the build of my new PC!

I found on Gumtree a Romanian guy selling 16gb of DDR4 ram + a Ryzen 5 1600 for £200. All brand new and sealed. The CPU alone is worth this, and the mem almost as much. Probably fell off a lorry. Needless to say, I had to upgrade my rig…

2x Corsair Vengeance 8gb DDR4 3200mhz Memory  
Ryzen 5 1600 3.2ghz/6 cores  
MSI GTX 1080 Gaming X +  
EVGA G3 550w GOLD PSU  
Fractal Design Mini C MicroATX Windowed Case  
MSI B350 Gaming Pro motherboard

Got the Ryzen OC at 3.8ghz on the stock cooler, pretty impressive in this small case. Also got the GPU up to 2000mhz.

Not bad, but not as amazing at 1080p as I thought. The Witcher 3 getting around 80-100fps on max, and BF1 somehow getting 120fps.

CS pretty solid at 300 on Mirage.

Time to upgrade, friends?

### [Ryanair Compensation Guide: Flight was late?](https://fazthebro.com/2017/08/22/ryanair-compensation-guide-flight-was-late/)

If your Ryanair flight was 3 hours late or more, you are entitled to compensation. (Unless it was due to weather)

*   250 Euros if the distance is 1500km or less
*   400 Euros if it is more than 1500km

Ryanair documentation [here](https://www.ryanair.com/content/dam/ryanair/help-centre-pdfs/eu261-version13/EU261%20for%20United%20Kingdom%20-%20EN.pdf)

Apply for the refund under EU rules: [Link](https://contactform.ryanair.com/?cr=eu261&lg=en&id=78)

Send them your bank details, they have to do it, don’t accept their bullshit excuses. Unless its weather, they have to pay you. In cash. Don’t accept Ryanair credit.

Their ‘new’ random seating algorithm doesn’t seat you together anymore – since July 2017. In fact it forces you to sit apart unless you pay. I had a flight where there was an empty seat next to me, but on the same booking we were put on opposite sides of the plane. So fuck those cunts.

Hate Ryanair.

The only thing that could make this fight entertaining is if Conor throws a kick by mistake

**Time in BST:**  
The fight is due to start at about 5.30am BST on Sunday 27 August in the UK (9.30pm on Saturday local time in Las Vegas).

**Stream:  
**I will post a good stream here closer to the time. Cmon, you would have to be retarded to pay for this.  
Lets be honest, this is a farce, they are both doing it purely for money, McGregor has 0 chance of winning this and he knows it.

**Funny take-away:**

Trying to find the start time for this fight was harder than I thought it should be. Take a look at this paragraph from the Telegraph:

> ### What date is the fight and at what time?
> 
> The fight is happening on Saturday 26 August. While the times haven’t been announced, it will certainly be a late night or very early start for viewers in the UK, so expect to be up well into Sunday 27 August, and possibly calling in sick on Monday 28. The main event begins at 4am BST, but the fight itself may start closer to 5am.

Can’t translate it? Neither can I. Is the fight on Sunday or Saturday UK time? Why do I need to get Monday off (even though its a bank holiday…?)

Mongs.

Wow. I had always heard about it, but never thought it would be _THIS_ good.

PopcornTime is the Netflix for pirates. It streams Torrents in real-time, has a huge movie and show library, and it’s all in glorious HD.  
The Windows UI looks like Netflix. It’s as simple as clicking the movie title, and bam you are seeing the latest titles!

![Image result for popcorn time](https://getpopcorntime.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download-popcorn-time.png)

As PopcornTime is provided by  pirates and not fat-cats – the library is huge, the interface works well, it supports ChromeCast out of the box (ahem, Amazon, ahem, cunts\*) and of course, its **free**.

It’s available on Windows, Mac and Android. Sorry iPhone users. But you knew you couldn’t access cool shit when you bought one.

I’m back. I’m back.

From Majorca! The Spanish island full of sun, sand, great tennis players, and…British people.

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/majorca.jpg)

‘Take me back’

Yep, 3 million British tourists go through Majorca each year, and almost as many Germans. In fact, it’s pretty hard to find a Spanish person – or a good price for a beer – anywhere.

That’s not to say it is a bad thing. The beaches are great, the beer is cold, and the food is good. It’s nice to be able to speak English on holiday, especially when my Spanish is…improving.

Rented a car while there, a little Fiat 500, in manual, which was surprisingly really fun. She had a hard time – no gear change was made under 6000RPM – but the old girl really came into her own. Foot to the floor up hills, couldn’t keep it over 100. Was pretty fun overtaking when you have 80HP.

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/car.jpg)

Fast, sleek, sexy, affordable. Great on gas too

So am I still continuing with the blog? Fuck yes I am. Currently jumping into some exciting projects using DSC and Chocolatey, to make building servers and PC’s fully automated. Pretty cool stuff right?

It’s been a great break, so before I get to the hardcore infosec stuff, ponder this:

_Are the pants industry and the purse industry are working together to keep women’s pockets small in order to force us to buy purses?_

We may never know.

### [New Planes!](https://fazthebro.com/2017/07/19/new-planes/)

This is for all you planespotters – we have a new Boeing and Airbus.

New 787!  Check out this:

> The 787-10 is the biggest variant of the 787, also known as the “Dreamliner”. The plane boasts the same 60m wingspan and 574cm cross-section as the 787-8 and 787-9, but at 68m is five metres longer than the 787-9 and can therefore pack in about 38 extra passengers in Boeing’s recommended configurations.

7 passengers per meter? Clearly not for the American Market. Or Italian. (Italian children are the most obese in the world!)

Model

Range

Seats

787-8

13,620 km

242

787-9

14,140 km

290

787-10

11,910 km

330

Also a smaller version of the Airbus A320, the A319 is here. Not very exciting to be honest. However, it is the first Airbus to not use Rolls Royce engines…interesting.

Coming up:

The Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, thinks it can get a single-aisled 160-seater into the air in mid-2017. Japan’s Mitsubishi is working on 88-and-76-seater jets, but has delayed their planned entry to service from 2018 to 2020 as it wrestles electrical issues.

Jappa engineering having reliability problems? Surely not. Hopefully the interior is done by Jan Beck.

### [Faz Facts: Concert Resale](https://fazthebro.com/2017/07/19/faz-facts-concert-resale/)

Jumping on to Viagogo today to have a look at the resale price of Blink-182 tickets in London tonight…was no small thing!

Look at this shit while ‘searching’ for tickets:

![At this point in time*](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/viagogo.png)

Only 80 tickets left! (At this point in time)

Not only does this look like a fake loading screen to scare you into buying, but it seems to have all false information. 23 other people viewing event? Sure, probably true. Only 80 tickets left? Bullshit. They get added frequently throughout the day. Less than 1% of tickets left for event? Completely false. Seated tickets are still on official sale, none have sold out.

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/viagogo2.png)

Who woulda thunk Blink 182 is a popular choice in 2017?

> But FTB, I love Viagogo, they provide a good service for real fans who can’t get tickets on sale day, and don’t mind paying a bit more, right?

Kind of. They do this, and also help others for when people suddenly can’t  make the concert. However sites like this are prime for scalpers to take advantage, which they do. But hey, that’s fine, because they are still letting the real fans get tickets after sale. So what’s the real problem?

_Viagogo are the scalpers._

A huge chunk of official Ticketmaster/Axs tickets get bought up by Viagogo and other reselling sites (sometimes as high as 40%) as soon as they are released. This guarantees selling out, and they make huge money off the mark-up, sometimes even having tickets not sell and expire. Viagogo literally just takes the money from the artist – as they agree to the official sale price.

Ticketmaster saw this happening – and obviously thought it was unfair. So like any company that cares for its customers, they made tickets ID only, and non-transferable. Just kidding.

**Ticketmaster opened their own ticket reseller.** Now when a concert goes on sale, Ticketmaster buys tickets from itself  (ahead in the queue of the other resellers) and sells them for premiums on a reselling site it owns.

Fucking scumbags.

### [Life Tips: How to Clean your Fidget Spinner](https://fazthebro.com/2017/07/18/life-tips-how-to-clean-your-fidget-spinner/)

After a week, my spinner started drastically going down in performance. From 2 minute spins, to 30 seconds – I was getting pretty depressed.

When you look closely at the bearing, you can actually see rust spots and dirt on the balls. These build up every few days from moisture in the air, and not enough spinning.

1.  Open up the bearing cover by pulling it or unscrewing it
2.  Get some Isopropyl alcohol or meths. Pour a small amount in.
3.  Spin that motherfucker dry!

This is the most effective way of cleaning. DON’T use WD40 or other oils, they actually hinder performance. Plus you can mix the Alcohol with a bit of juice or coke for a refreshing drink!

### [The Hardest Question of Our Childhood](https://fazthebro.com/2017/07/12/the-hardest-question-of-our-childhood/)

Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle?
-----------------------------------

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pokemon__by_bureika-d5i8wqg.jpg)

Who did you choose?

Undoubtedly one of the most important days of my life, was Christmas 1999. Leading up to it, I was camping with my family in Waikuku beach. I picked up a Game Boy original from a garage sale for $20 and was stoked (even without any games, having such slick tech was _coool!)_

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nin-183x300.jpg)

Days later, I found out that Santa had brought me _Pokemon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition._ I looked at the box art, and me oh my yes boy did I enjoy that.

That shit belongs in the Louvre.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Pokemon_Yellow.png)

Electrifying as it comes

Chomping at the bit, after reading the instruction manual on how to play the game (yes, back then games actually came with a lovely notebook on how to play, with nice visuals and tips) and putting in the 4 AA batteries, I powered on this black-and-white dot matrix beauty.

I had to choose a name. Back then I wasn’t known as FTB, the internet was in it’s infancy and gamertags weren’t really a thing – plus I was 9 years old. I’m pretty sure I put something epic like ‘Fraser’ as the name, waited for Prof. Oak to remember his grandsons name, and into Kanto I was teleported.

Soon, came the biggest decision…for most kids. Grass, Fire or Water. In Pokemon Yellow, you are given a Pikachu, and he follows you around, which was pretty awesome for the time. No decisions for me – however I then went on to play one of the best games I have ever played.

But lets say I was one of the luckier kids who got Pokemon Red the summer before, who do you choose?

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pokemon___kanto_starters_by_oronoda-d8704tu.png)

There is no clear winner on cuteness

**So which one is best?**
-------------------------

My first playthrough of Pokemon Red – I chose Bulbasaur. I thought Grass Pokemon were cool, I thought Bulbasaur was cool, according to _The Pokemon Handbook_ he was easy to train, and Vine-Whip was _badass.  
_

To the new user, Bulbasaur and Squirtle were the easier options to start with. You could easily take out Brock, and no type disadvantage with Misty. Later in the game however, Blastoise started to have problems being only a water type, and Venusaur didn’t really have any attacking moves outside of Razor Leaf, which is bad against common flying Pokemon. Charmander was always the ‘hardcore’ choice. Hard to start against gyms, harder to evolve, learns moves really late in level.

As it stands in the competitive battling scene, none of them are used in top tiers anymore (excluding mega versions). In fact, none of them have ever really been used competitively, with the exception of Venusaur as a tank/sleep powder user. Charizard rarely ever sees play due to his horrible speed. Blastoise has always been useless, due to only a water typing, bad movepool, and average stats.

All three Pokemon have the same share of stats – Venusaur being the more defensive and special attacker, Charizard the speedy physical attacker, and Blastoise the slow all-rounder. I think it’s safe to say Blastoise is the shit choice, Venusaur the ‘easy mode’ choice, and Charizard the ‘harder mode’ choice.

All of this said, if one day Pokemon becomes reality, you bet your ass:

I’d choose Charmander.

We have all heard of Petya by now, the huge attack that mainly affected Ukraine. The 3rd largest law firm in the world was reduced to pen and paper for a week, and shipping firm TNT was out for days. But there is one other story that may be slightly more relevant for the boys…

This recent cyber-attack is going to cost Reckitt, one of the worlds biggest companies, £100m. Reckitt is known for owning Nurofen amongst other brands. Their suppliers got hit by the attack, putting shipping orders on hold for days.

The main problem with this is: Reckitt also own _Durex._ AND _Dettol._

Not only does this put your PC in danger of a virus, there are ramifications outside of cyberspace as well.  Not being able to wrap up – or take Dettol precautions after a ‘featherlite’ run – could cause problems for punters. Even getting that far may be difficult if you can’t flash a display pack!

### [Faz Facts: Cooling The Tube](https://fazthebro.com/2017/07/05/faz-facts-cooling-the-tube/)

As you all know, the team here at fazthebro.com are a bit crazy about planes, cars, and of course the tube. (Well, maybe just the blue bullet)

Being a hairy sweaty palmed man like myself, the tube can get pretty unbearable in Summer, even on our beloved bullet. How they ventilate the tube is fascinating. For instance, when the Bakerloo line opened in 1906 it was advertised with a _maximum temperature of 16 °C!!_ 

Would be nice to get that in Winter!

Temperatures of 47 °C were reported in the 2006 European heat wave – one I luckily was not here for. However I was here for the heat wave last year – I think it only got up to around 42 then. That was pretty horrible, and I’m allowed to wear shorts and a beater to work. Not impressed? Try this on for size:

_A 2000 study reported that air quality was seventy-three times worse than at street level, with a passenger breathing the same mass of particulates during a twenty-minute journey on the Northern line as when smoking a cigarette._

Woah, the _Northern line_? That’s a pretty new line right? In other words, lets get darts back on the tube! Seems to have no worse effects, and menthols probably make it smell better too.

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/northern.jpg)

The Silent Killer.

How does it cool? Basically, at the large stations such as Oxford Circus and Green Park (both bullet lines incidentally) there are huge refrigerators that cool the tunnels just outside the platforms. They can be powered like traditional air con units, or at some stations, deep underground wells to cold water are used. The trains then push the cold air around. This is becoming less effective, as stations are getting larger, and air is being displaced less efficiently.

Also, the brakes on the train create energy that is used to cool the cabins. An idea was floated to put air-con units on each carriage, but it was found that it actually _heated_ the tunnels more than they could cool the cabins.

There is a £100k reward for anyone who can figure out how to cool the deeper lines. So send in your idea if you get one!

Hey Az, great question. I know how you feel! For instance, this Sunday passed I went to the JUSTIN BIEBER concert and wow, was not feeling great on the Monday. I was like you, and needed extra drive. So what did I do? Well I…took a sick day. However this was before I discovered…

### [In Bruges](https://fazthebro.com/2017/06/29/in-bruges/)

Just got back from an epic day out in – what can only be described as – ‘not a shithole’ Bruges!!

It really is a fairytale town. All the canals and bridges and cobbled streets and  churches, all that beautiful fucking fairytale stuff, how can that not be somebody’s fucking thing, eh?

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bruges1.jpg)

How can the swans not be somebodys fucking thing?

After a walk around the main square looking for some food we did the usual _Hmmm I don’t know about this restaurant. Let’s keep looking, maybe somewhere outside of the square? A street over will be cheaper._

30 minutes later…ended in a tourist trap restaurant. Fuck it, the beer was gooudt. Certified mint.

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bruges2.jpg)

Beers, mussels, fries, and Brussels.

Next we went up the bell tower. Gotta say if you haven’t been – it is really narrow!!

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bruges4.jpg)

We survived the climb down (took a lot longer than I thought, the movie may not be entirely inaccurate with how much time Ken has to climb up and jump)

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bruges3.jpg)

What am I trying to say? You’re a bunch of fookin elephants!!

Ended up in a pub overlooking the canal, got pretty thirsty from the climb. We thought we should probably try and find some spots from the movie before we left. Should fate have it, the pub we were in, was in fact _the Hotel from the movie!_ Ray jumped into the canal right in front of our faces.

Brill time out!

### [Security Tip Of the Weak: Pa55w0rds!](https://fazthebro.com/2017/06/22/security-tip-of-the-weak-pa55w0rds/)

See what I did there? Probably not.

Passwords. We all have ’em, we all need ’em, and we all use the same one everywhere\*. Well, maybe except for your banking. That one is _goooood._ Amirite?

### So what is a good password?

A good password is something a person with good knowledge about you couldn’t guess, and is long enough that a computer can’t crack it. That’s about it!

### Err…shouldn’t I be using upper and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and undiscovered hieroglyphs in it?

Sure, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, and it sure makes it hard for a human to guess. But if it is so complex that you have to write it down, it basically defeats the purpose.

_Mongs at my work who have it taped to their keyboard! Read this!_

Password complexity is pretty bollocks in my opinion, it makes passwords hard for humans to remember and easy for computers to guess (they don’t care about the letters really, only length, unless it is a purely dictionary based attack). Also, once you have a ‘good’ password, you are likely to use it in multiple places.

**Enter: Password Managers.**

A password manager is a bit of software for your PC and Phone, which uses one ‘master’ password to unlock, and then stores different passwords for you for each website. That way, if a site gets hacked, they only get the random password you used for that site. Check out Lastpass. I’ve even seen guys who just type in random shit into a sign up page, because they know they won’t use the account again. If you need it, use the forgot password link.

Most important, have a good password for banking and email. And remember to 2 factor all the things!!!!!

Also, the frequent crashes hopefully shouldn’t be happening anymore: I fixed a bug in the rocketchat server that was leaking memory. A.k.a: STOP SENDING SO MUCH FAN MAIL! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Yesterday’s 3pm walk took us around markets, protests, churches, MI6, Westminster and beyond. Was really top notch. We were with fill, and he actually made it kinda brill, filling us up with his knowledge of the area. Sorry Jase!

Anyway, top highlight for me was definitely the Jewel house, a hidden _gem_ across the road from parliament. Made in the 1300’s, its a pretty cool wee building:

Due to the loud drilling, we have moved offices, into _Real London!_

Lots of food places, old buildings to see and lots of people. The offices are nice, and only a few floors above the Labour Party. Give us a wave savior Corbyn! We haven’t seen Him yet but we hope He joins us on a 3pm walk sometime.

Here’s the latest pic of our walk last week – visiting Westminster Cathedral. The premier cathedral in London is actually a real piece of shit, the outside is orange brick and the inside is even worse. It looks like there was a fire inside about 200 years ago that never got cleaned out, however they say:

_‘the black ceiling is intentional, as each generation should decorate it with new mosaics’_

Yeah…half a millennium of generations artwork later…don’t bother seeing it.

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/winny.jpg)

Clearing the mind and clearing our sin. 3pm walk is a cleansing process.

**Now I know what you are thinking. PHIL? ON THE WALK?**

Yes, you aren’t mistaken, you are still on fazthebro.com and not a scam site. Check the SSL cert if you like.

Fill came down, he seems more relaxed in these new offices (rumour is that he talked to the receptionist and she didn’t initially scowl at him)

So…with fill…was kind of ok? Semi-Brill?

This week’s Mong comes from the greatest spawn of Mongs in the southern hemisphere – and arguably the world – _Australia._

After having a delicious Thai meal in a restaurant down the road, we are waiting to pay. A table of loud obnoxious people (our Aussies) are looking over their bill, and are clearly puzzled. They ask for some clarification, presumably for some Thai words they don’t understand.

> “Excuse me, what is this ‘gratuity’? We didn’t order that.”

The Thai waitress froze, unsure on how to explain this without making them look like complete imbeciles.

> “Ah, that is the service charge, you don’t have to pay it if you wish”

The Aussies didn’t realise at all how stupid they looked, and said “Oh ok! We are happy to pay it.”

Mongs!

Hi Abdulla,

Thanks for the support, really appreciate it. Currently I’m sitting here learning very quickly why failover clustering over VPN and different subnets is a bad idea…but more on that later!

Good question! I’ll try to keep it as brief as possible – while going a bit in depth. For reference, i’m using a Galaxy S7 (thanks Trandy) and it’s a fucking awesome phone.

**Document Scanner – Office Lens**

If you haven’t tried this app out, trust me, it’s fucking awesome. It turns your camera into a document scanner. It doesn’t matter what angle you take the picture, it will straighten it out like you have scanned it. Made by MSFT.  
I have used it to send official documents to Czech/London embassy, and they accepted them, even though they need legit scans. Really recommend.

**Cloud Storage – Google Drive**

Previously I used _Dropbox_ with the 15gb they give you with a Samsung. Dropbox is fine, but I found it to be super expensive (paid options are 30gb, or 1TB as the next hop – I don’t need that much!)  
Google drive gives a nice price ~$2.99 a month for 100gb storage. I make sure I backup all my photos here in full quality, as the free version compresses them. (Although I have heard the compression method is very good)

**Web Browser – Samsung Internet**

“WHATTT?? WHY NOT CHROME?? HGSHKJNHDSG”

That’s right, I use Samsungs stock browser. I personally find it fast, slick, and lightweight. Chrome became a super hungry best for me, and my battery life has increased dramatically. Plus you can install an ad-blocker, use fingerprint for passwords stored in Knox. Give it a try if you can!

**Weather – Yahoo!**

I! know! I’ll! get! laughed! at! for! this! one!  
It has the most no-nonsense interface for me. No clicks or swipes required. Awful for NZ but good for London.

**Keyboard – Swiftkey**

I like to have all my numbers and punctuation on one screen. Can’t be bothered doing a pointless click on the ‘123’ button.

**Other fun apps:**

*   Skymap – Map the night sky
*   File Manager
*   Duolingo
*   Colornote

Hope that satisfies your APPetite!

Cheers,

FTB

These pesky sports rights holders are making their coverage more and more expensive. Who can afford to buy a whole sky package so you can watch (some) of the premier league? Don’t play NBA in your town? Look no further.

App for Android, and available on PC, this streaming engine connects you with other users in P2P (like torrents) and provides an ad-free HD experience. It is in beta, I have used it a few times and it is OK. The more popular the sport is the more stable it is, but the quality is fantastic and is safe to use.

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/mong.png)

This weeks Mong comes from one of the great Mongspawns:

**Brixton.**

Inside a very busy, lightly staffed bar, our Mong decides to buy a round of 10 drinks for all the boys. £50 total. Wants to pay by card:

_Declined_

Oh well, fair enough, he probably just got the pin wrong. Trying again:

_Declined_

Right, either this guy is really thick or has no money. Again?

_Declined_

Oblivious to the huge queue behind him (with me beside him) he takes out his phone to check his balance on the card. Waitress now looking at me, like ‘what the fuck is this guy doing…’  
After a few minutes, I see he has £47 on his card. Was going to offer him a couple quid to pay the rest but didn’t have any. He asks to pay 40 on that card, and another 10 on his other card. Waitress reluctantly agrees. 40 goes through fine, and then £10 on the second card….

_Declined_

So I’m pretty frustrated, say to him ‘mate just get one of your friends to pay this, what the fuck are you doing’ etc etc  
He ignores me, proceeds to open up the app for his second card…has £6 on it.

Our Mong then is just staring blankly at his phone, wondering what to do now. One of his more intelligent friends sees the problem, comes over and just pays the 10. Finally he is gone! 1 Minute later, my rum and cokes are poured and my contactless goes through.

Later on in the night, the guy shoves me for ‘being a dick at the bar.’

What a Mong.

[https://monzo.com/](https://monzo.com/)

A app-based ‘bank’ with a pre-paid debit card with contactless. No fees for spending abroad and no ATM fees. No bank account, so you can’t get paid into here.

The idea is that you only use this card for everything, and manage your money by the app. It’s smart, so can categorize any spending (pub, supermarket etc) and you can set limits (£300 a month on food, for example)

If you are new to London, and just need a card for paying for shit, this could be a good option. It’s free, the card is free, and comes within days.

A cake/coffee place near work, it is pink, expensive, and always in the shade. This of course is a great combination for any hipster, and undoubtedly we find it full every time we walk past. Sitting outside on the hard ‘vintage’ chairs while it’s 8 degrees and raining, and not getting away for under a tenner, is a must do in London.

Every 3pm walk we go past here, we see a token Asian table, a rich mum with her baby, and a couple where the man looks like he’d wish he was anywhere else! Anyway, here’s the pic:

### [Home Wifi Tip: Change the Channel](https://fazthebro.com/2017/05/23/home-wifi-tip-change-the-channel/)

Shitty home WiFi? It may be because of your channel!  
WiFi signals are sent out on a ‘channel’, which is basically a number the signal is broadcasted at. If two people next to each other are on the same channel, the signal gets distorted and unhappy.

You likely have two signals coming from your router: 5ghz and 2.4ghz. All new phones will be using the former, but your laptop (and budget phones) may be using the latter.

1.  Download [Wifi Analyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer&hl=en_GB) from the App Store/Play Store
2.  Have a look at the channel graph on 5G and 2.4G, see how many are overlapping. For example, look at this clusterfuck on 2.4 at my work: 
    
    ![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wifi.png)
    
    Really impress your date: ‘The wifi in here has many overlapping humps, like we might be, m’ lady’
    
3.  Pick a spot in between your neighbors. As you can see, we have multiple points, (MWG) which are spaced out to avoid problems.
4.  Log in to your router – instructions how are normally printed on it – and change to the signal free number! This is very easy on 5ghz, the range is very large.

That’s about all there is to it. It’s so easy when you know how.

I believe the Govt has fabricated these weather reports, to keep people in the UK for the bank holiday weekend. More people = more money. London is never this nice!

HTTP/2 combines multiple requests into a few single ones. I think. Either way, considering the overwhelming amount of traffic I get, your user experience on the blog should become something like this:

By now, you have followed the blog, and religiously followed the tips and tricks to keep your IT bubble safe. I say religiously because Jesus, you followers are like a cult! Appreciate the support!

Something we talk less about though, is your home security. How can you up the game there? As we know, physical access to any machine is basically game over. Take a look at the Riversdale door lock:

![](https://fazthebro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20170506_135130.jpg)

Attempted break in at the River

Notice the crowbar marks on the door. The reprobates that attempted this break in clearly didn’t see the swag of our Banham™ lock! Even so, they didn’t get in because of one simple thing:

**_We lock our door._**

78% of London homes aren’t locked. They just shut the door behind them, and hope that keeps it closed. Most people aren’t even aware you can lock the door after closing. If you just close it behind you, a cordless drill can go through the wood, and press the latch. Open sesame!

Keep that door locked team, especially on weekends. Give the robbers the same disappointment their mothers have for them.

Since the closure of the Spoons near us, we’ve had to branch out to new exciting places for Friday lunch – you can imagine how fun that is with Phil walking with you…¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

We have found a great wee Japanese place with the nicest owners. Shit ton of beef, katsu, rice and salad for £6.50. Tastes great too. We do feel a pang of guilt that we are cheating on themarket guys, and yes we all still hope all salads yes is feeling better. I will update you on the emotional situation on Thursday.

Anyway, if you are near Victoria, Tachbrook Street Market is simply:

### [The Enemy of my Enemy…](https://fazthebro.com/2017/05/15/the-enemy-of-my-enemy/)

Well, where to begin? Sorry for taking so long guys, and thanks for the letters, I appreciate it. Let’s get started.

WANNACRY
--------

*   74 countries hit so far
*   200,000 computers
*   NHS and Spain’s Telefonica crippled

One of the largest cyber attacks in history, Wannacrypt has literally swept the continent. So what is it? Basically, it is a virus that encrypts your personal files. This can be thought of as locking them, and a password needed to get open them again. The password can be purchased for around $300.

If you get hit, and you lose things, you probably are safe to pay the money. To be fair, the guys doing the scam are very helpful in getting the files back – much better customer service than some other websites \*cough\* \*Ryanair\* \*cough\* \*cunts\* \*cough cough\*

_“I don’t have anything on my PC I care about, I don’t need to be protected”_

Do you have personal photos? Documents? All these will be lost together, unless they are backed up somewhere else.  
Have Dropbox/Google drive as a backup? Is it a linked folder on your PC? Bye-bye.

_How can I protect myself?_

DO YOUR WINDOWS UPDATES. IT’S THAT SIMPLE. DO THEM TONIGHT. GET OFF FUCKING XP. DON’T OPEN RANDOM FILES FROM THE WEB.  
Backup your photos properly:

*   Current set on the phone
*   Free backup to google drive/icloud
*   External hard drive updated often (not attached to pc)

This is going to be a big one. Our company hasn’t been hit, cause i’m the man. Get your GPOs, SMBv1 disabled, FSRM, Canarys in check admins.

### [Tip: Change your fucking WiFi SSID](https://fazthebro.com/2017/05/12/tip-change-your-fucking-wifi-ssid/)

The amount of times I go to peoples houses and ask for the wifi details…

_“Oh its name is voda-12aec5 and the password is in our flat chat…hold on I’ll try find it…_  
_Yep found it so the password is 36c88d6ccb”_

It almost infuriates me as much as waiting in a Finsbury Park self-checkout line. (Mongs)

When you are on your wifi, in most cases, just type in 192.168.1.1 into your phones browser. It will be written on the router which number to put in. From there, use the username and password provided on the router. Now you get an easy webpage to change the name and password! It takes about 1 minute.

Go the Black Caps!

Hi P,

I’m currently sitting here, celebrating a triumph – we got an AWS Lambda instance to resize images on the fly when people want different sizes. But anyway, don’t want to get you too into that 😉

Answer: Three or Vodafone.

Need a phone? Go with Vodafone. They give you an iPhone 7 or Galaxy S7 + good data allowance for £30-35 a month. (And have a good network)

BYO phone? I’d go with Three. 12gb data for £20 a month. Service is average though. You also get free data in 20 countries!

FTB

UPDATE:

Vodafone have a flash deal now for 12 months sim-only contract. £20, 20gb data, free roaming in all of Europe. Get on it!

### [Lunch Meta: Healthy Sains Work Lunch](https://fazthebro.com/2017/05/09/lunch-meta-healthy-sains-work-lunch/)

**Monday:**  
Whole Chicken – £5.50 – divide this into 3

**Monday, Tuesday & Wednesday:**  
Microwave steam broccoli – £1  
Sains side (4 bean salad, pasta, sweet chili noodles) £1.50

Price per meal: £4.33

Super easy work lunch for the lazy. The microwave steam broccoli is actually really nice. Each meal fills you up good with a lot of meat and carb.

Only admin is carving and saving the chicken for 3 days.

Remember once you get through this, you have market on Thursday and pub on Friday to look forward to!

Quick tip for the day – not security related but I’m sure you all will cope.

30mbps – may be slow for streaming in HD in peak time.

50mbps – a nice sweet spot

76mbps – fast and affordable

Go with Vodafone for home broadband. It’s 76, same price as any competitor and they only offer 50. No landline included which is what you want.

Two years ago, I would hear: “_I don’t trust contactless, I don’t want someone able to just take my wallet and go nuts.”_

We never hear that now, and why? Because contactless is fuckin awesome and if you don’t use it you are a **mong**. Plus it has a perfect cap for a round of beers.

In today’s special, we are talking contactless, Android/Apple Pay, and of course, security. Contactless is currently the most secure way to pay for goods at a till. Cash can be stolen, cards skimmed, contactless…can’t if you do it right.

**Tip 1: Use Android or Apple pay.**

Fingerprint auth. Virtual card numbers. Sex. When you pay with one of these apps, a one-time virtual credit card number is created for you, every transaction. This way, the retailer never knows what your real card number is – and can’t buy anything even with the full card details. Also, if you lose your wallet, your card can be used. If you lose your phone, your card (should be) protected by your fingerprint/PIN. Gets me hard thinking of it.

**Tip 2: Check your receipts (London)**

If for some sick reason you have to use your real card, make sure to check the receipt they offer you (especially in bars). Many bars will give you the Merchant receipt back, which has your full card details printed on there, complete with expiry date.  In a bar, reprobates are known to pick these up and sell them.

**Tip 3: Wrap Up**

If you can’t make payments through your wallet, then you are probably safe. A popular new scam on public transport in London is on the rise, whereby a reprobate carries a small contactless terminal on their person, and press it against your wallet in your pocket, hoping for a payment. Special cases/thick wallets/awareness are the best combat for this.

Hope you enjoyed the tip of the day, let us know in the comments your favourite contactless tricks!

Feeling a bit sick today, thanks all of you for the get well soon messages. Today is the day to sit down and really enjoy some uninterrupted working time! Wish I could work here every day, it really is more productive. Mechanical keyboard increases workrate by at least 30%!

### [Security Tip of the Day: AntiVirus](https://fazthebro.com/2017/04/28/security-tip-of-the-day-antivirus/)

![](https://cdn.meme.am/instances/54348255.jpg)

Is it?

Hi all, back again with another security tip of the day (can’t really be bothered making too many more of these, so enjoy while it lasts)

AntiVirus. Everyone gets pissed off by it, but everyone needs it.

**OR DO THEY?**

Personally, I don’t run any extra antivirus applications on my devices other than out of the box. User knowledge and common sense is far greater than anything an AntiVirus can give you. This is because by its very nature, viruses are ahead of AntiVirus, _all the time._

With Windows, the best thing you can do is get to Windows 10, always do Windows updates, and turn on Windows defender. It’s actually pretty good. Don’t download stupid shit from the internet. Use a separate admin user and logged-in user. It’s that easy.

**Never pay for antivirus. Defender is just as good if you aren’t retarded.**

Apps like Norton actually feel like a virus; they slow down your computer, and have been known to ADD vulnerabilities, so why use them? Maybe you have to for work. If you must, a good lightweight option is bitdefender free:

[https://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html](https://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html)

**IOS/Android:**

Never get antivirus, ever. Your phone is much better than anything you can download. All apps run in a sandbox, so the app can’t even access anything else on the phone. It will slow it down and do nothing.

**MAC:**

Sell that POS and get off the blog.

Friday 5pm – that’s about it for today, beer time!!

_Fill: Look how long that line for KFC is…those guys better not get -FUCK what are they doing don’t they have work to do?? Oh right, they just work on that stupid blog…_

KFC in England is a bit like that girl at a festival…you spent a lot of money, it’s fatty, and you kind of regret it after. Todays meal was 2 pieces of chicken, 4 wings, 2 tenderloins and chips. I think I got about 50g of actual chicken on it. Stick to PFC lads!

### [Security Tip of the Day: Mobile Password](https://fazthebro.com/2017/04/27/security-tip-of-the-day-mobile-password/)

![](https://img.gadgethacks.com/img/23/21/63475275407196/0/unlock-your-ipod-touch-iphone-and-remove-passcode.1280x600.jpg)

A mobile password is something that everyone should have, period. Everyone has something to hide, and your phone is likely connected to almost all of them.

If you lose your phone, or it is stolen, (thanks Finsbury Park scooter guys) you want to make sure that they cannot access any of your data, which is far more important than the hardware itself. Access to your email is access to everything, and even if you think you have nothing of worth, a stolen identity is far too common to ignore.

1\. Thumbprint

The thumbprint is the most convenient way to open your phone, and is relatively secure. It won’t stop the CIA or a determined individual from accessing your accounts, but it will thwart a casual mugger or a lost phone.

2\. Pin Code + Erase Data

This is one of the most important – a Pin code on a reboot, and a maximum number of tries before the phone wipes itself. This CAN beat the govt departments, as shown by Apple v FBI last year. Remember, “If the cops come knockin’ you better start lockin'” – turn your phone off if you ever think you are going to be arrested. On a reboot, the phone requires a pin entry, not thumb, and they can’t force you to give the password.

3\. Encryption

Encrypt everything on your phone. It’s normally the default. If you don’t, anyone can access your nudes by just plugging the phone into a computer.

Hope you enjoyed tip of the day, and keep tuned for more updates 🙂

Every Thursday we head down to the market for a market, which is a good 15 minute walk from the office (lunch break is 30 mins)

They have epic kebabs for £4.50 that are almost too big to eat. Plus we get to see all of our mates down there. From left to right in the photo there is:

*   Good meat guy
*   All salads yes
*   Halloumi guy

Today ‘All salads yes’ looked really down in the dumps, our thoughts are with him and his troubles he must be having. Surely he can’t be sick of his job. To every cloud there is a silver lining however, because of his sadness, he actually wrapped the kebab properly!

Cheers to the team at the market for their epic hospitality.

If your movie isn’t on Netflix and you can’t afford a subscription to anything else, what do you do?

Probably head to _thepiratebay_.

There are always risks with downloading from strangers on the internet, however installing apps like netflix, hulu, sky etc also come with their own bloat and adware. Here are my tips for safe stealing searching:

*   For movies, use https://yts.ag/ wherever possible. These are YIFY movies direct from him, are generally safe, high quality, with fast downloads. (also has subtitles if you have a continental gf)
*   Use UTorrent as your client. Most secure, fastest and lightweight there is.
*   Be an asshole. Don’t seed for 1 second longer than it takes to download. 99% of piracy notices come from SEEDING not LEECHING.
*   Check the comments/amount of seeders/’trusted’ users if you are unsure.

Stay tuned for more security tips and stay safe!
